TOM Preface
TOM 
TOM MOST of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two
TOM were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates
TOM of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an
TOM individual -- he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys
TOM whom I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of
TOM architecture.
TOM 
TOM The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and
TOM slaves in the West at the period of this story -- that is to say, thirty
TOM or forty years ago.
TOM 
TOM Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and
TOM girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,
TOM for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what
TOM they once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked,
TOM and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.

TOM 
TOM ``TOM!''
TOM 
TOM No answer.
TOM 
TOM ``TOM!''
TOM 
TOM No answer.
TOM 
TOM ``What's gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!''
TOM 
TOM No answer.
TOM 
TOM The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the
TOM room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or
TOM never looked THROUGH them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her
TOM state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for ``style,'' not
TOM service -- she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as
TOM well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely,
TOM but still loud enough for the furniture to hear:
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll --''
TOM 
TOM She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching
TOM under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the
TOM punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.
TOM 
TOM ``I never did see the beat of that boy!''
TOM 
TOM She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the
TOM tomato vines and ``jimpson'' weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom.
TOM So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and
TOM shouted:
TOM 
TOM ``Y-o-u-u TOM!''
TOM 
TOM There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize
TOM a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.
TOM 
TOM ``There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in
TOM there?''
TOM 
TOM ``Nothing.''
TOM 
TOM ``Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What IS that
TOM truck?''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't know, aunt.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I know. It's jam -- that's what it is. Forty times I've said if
TOM you didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch.''
TOM 
TOM The switch hovered in the air -- the peril was desperate --
TOM 
TOM ``My! Look behind you, aunt!''
TOM 
TOM The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger. The
TOM lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and
TOM disappeared over it.
TOM 
TOM His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
TOM laugh.
TOM 
TOM ``Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me tricks
TOM enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old
TOM fools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an old dog new tricks,
TOM as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,
TOM and how is a body to know what's coming? He 'pears to know just how long
TOM he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make
TOM out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and
TOM I can't hit him a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's
TOM the Lord's truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as
TOM the Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I
TOM know. He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he's my own dead
TOM sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash him,
TOM somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and
TOM every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is
TOM born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says,
TOM and I reckon it's so. He'll play hookey this evening, * and [*
TOM Southwestern for ``afternoon''] I'll just be obleeged to make him work,
TOM to-morrow, to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays,
TOM when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he
TOM hates anything else, and I've GOT to do some of my duty by him, or I'll
TOM be the ruination of the child.''
TOM 
TOM Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home
TOM barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day's wood
TOM and split the kindlings before supper -- at least he was there in time
TOM to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.
TOM Tom's younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through
TOM with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,
TOM and had no adventurous, troublesome ways.
TOM 
TOM While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity
TOM offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and
TOM very deep -- for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like
TOM many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she
TOM was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she
TOM loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low
TOM cunning. Said she:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes'm.''
TOM 
TOM ``Powerful warm, warn't it?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes'm.''
TOM 
TOM ``Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM A bit of a scare shot through Tom -- a touch of uncomfortable suspicion.
TOM He searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing. So he said:
TOM 
TOM ``No'm -- well, not very much.''
TOM 
TOM The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said:
TOM 
TOM ``But you ain't too warm now, though.'' And it flattered her to reflect
TOM that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing
TOM that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew
TOM where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:
TOM 
TOM ``Some of us pumped on our heads -- mine's damp yet. See?''
TOM 
TOM Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
TOM circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new
TOM inspiration:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to
TOM pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!''
TOM 
TOM The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket. His shirt
TOM collar was securely sewed.
TOM 
TOM ``Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey and
TOM been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a
TOM singed cat, as the saying is -- better'n you look. THIS time.''
TOM 
TOM She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom
TOM had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.
TOM 
TOM But Sidney said:
TOM 
TOM ``Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread,
TOM but it's black.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!''
TOM 
TOM But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:
TOM 
TOM ``Siddy, I'll lick you for that.''
TOM 
TOM In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into
TOM the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them -- one needle
TOM carried white thread and the other black. He said:
TOM 
TOM ``She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes
TOM she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to
TOM geeminy she'd stick to one or t'other -- I can't keep the run of 'em.
TOM But I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll learn him!''
TOM 
TOM He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well
TOM though -- and loathed him.
TOM 
TOM Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not
TOM because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a
TOM man's are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore them
TOM down and drove them out of his mind for the time -- just as men's
TOM misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new
TOM interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired
TOM from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It
TOM consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,
TOM produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short
TOM intervals in the midst of the music -- the reader probably remembers how
TOM to do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave
TOM him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full
TOM of harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer
TOM feels who has discovered a new planet -- no doubt, as far as strong,
TOM deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy,
TOM not the astronomer.
TOM 
TOM The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom
TOM checked his whistle. A stranger was before him -- a boy a shade larger
TOM than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive
TOM curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy
TOM was well dressed, too -- well dressed on a week-day. This was simply
TOM astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth
TOM roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes
TOM on -- and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of
TOM ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The
TOM more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose
TOM at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him
TOM to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved -- but only
TOM sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the
TOM time. Finally Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``I can lick you!''
TOM 
TOM ``I'd like to see you try it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I can do it.''
TOM 
TOM ``No you can't, either.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes I can.''
TOM 
TOM ``No you can't.''
TOM 
TOM ``I can.''
TOM 
TOM ``You can't.''
TOM 
TOM ``Can!''
TOM 
TOM ``Can't!''
TOM 
TOM An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``What's your name?''
TOM 
TOM ``'Tisn't any of your business, maybe.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well I 'low I'll MAKE it my business.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well why don't you?''
TOM 
TOM ``If you say much, I will.''
TOM 
TOM ``Much -- much -- MUCH. There now.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, you think you're mighty smart, DON'T you? I could lick you with
TOM one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well why don't you DO it? You SAY you can do it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well I WILL, if you fool with me.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh yes -- I've seen whole families in the same fix.''
TOM 
TOM ``Smarty! You think you're SOME, now, DON'T you? Oh, what a hat!''
TOM 
TOM ``You can lump that hat if you don't like it. I dare you to knock it off
TOM -- and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs.''
TOM 
TOM ``You're a liar!''
TOM 
TOM ``You're another.''
TOM 
TOM ``You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up.''
TOM 
TOM ``Aw -- take a walk!''
TOM 
TOM ``Say -- if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a
TOM rock off'n your head.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, of COURSE you will.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well I WILL.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well why don't you DO it then? What do you keep SAYING you will for?
TOM Why don't you DO it? It's because you're afraid.''
TOM 
TOM ``I AIN'T afraid.''
TOM 
TOM ``You are.''
TOM 
TOM ``I ain't.''
TOM 
TOM ``You are.''
TOM 
TOM Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently
TOM they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``Get away from here!''
TOM 
TOM ``Go away yourself!''
TOM 
TOM ``I won't.''
TOM 
TOM ``I won't either.''
TOM 
TOM So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both
TOM shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But
TOM neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and
TOM flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``You're a coward and a pup. I'll tell my big brother on you, and he can
TOM thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it, too.''
TOM 
TOM ``What do I care for your big brother? I've got a brother that's bigger
TOM than he is -- and what's more, he can throw him over that fence, too.''
TOM [Both brothers were imaginary.]
TOM 
TOM ``That's a lie.''
TOM 
TOM ``YOUR saying so don't make it so.''
TOM 
TOM Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:
TOM 
TOM ``I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand
TOM up. Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep.''
TOM 
TOM The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Don't you crowd me now; you better look out.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, you SAID you'd do it -- why don't you do it?''
TOM 
TOM ``By jingo! for two cents I WILL do it.''
TOM 
TOM The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
TOM with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys
TOM were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and
TOM for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and
TOM clothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves
TOM with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the
TOM fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him
TOM with his fists. ``Holler 'nuff!'' said he.
TOM 
TOM The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying -- mainly from
TOM rage.
TOM 
TOM ``Holler 'nuff!'' -- and the pounding went on.
TOM 
TOM At last the stranger got out a smothered ``'Nuff!'' and Tom let him up
TOM and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next
TOM time.''
TOM 
TOM The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,
TOM snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
TOM threatening what he would do to Tom the ``next time he caught him out.''
TOM To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and
TOM as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it
TOM and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an
TOM antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he
TOM lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the
TOM enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the
TOM window and declined. At last the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom
TOM a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but
TOM he said he ``'lowed'' to ``lay'' for that boy.
TOM 
TOM He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in at
TOM the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and
TOM when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his
TOM Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its
TOM firmness.

TOM Chapter II
TOM 
TOM SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and
TOM fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if
TOM the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in
TOM every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom
TOM and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond
TOM the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far
TOM enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.
TOM 
TOM Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
TOM long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and
TOM a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board
TOM fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a
TOM burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost
TOM plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant
TOM whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed
TOM fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at
TOM the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from
TOM the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but
TOM now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at
TOM the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there
TOM waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,
TOM skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred
TOM and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an
TOM hour -- and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some.''
TOM 
TOM Jim shook his head and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Can't, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git dis water
TOM an' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody. She say she spec' Mars Tom gwine
TOM to ax me to whitewash, an' so she tole me go 'long an' 'tend to my own
TOM business -- she 'lowed SHE'D 'tend to de whitewashin'.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That's the way she always
TOM talks. Gimme the bucket -- I won't be gone only a a minute. SHE won't
TOM ever know.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, I dasn't, Mars Tom. Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head off'n
TOM me. 'Deed she would.''
TOM 
TOM ``SHE! She never licks anybody -- whacks 'em over the head with her
TOM thimble -- and who cares for that, I'd like to know. She talks awful,
TOM but talk don't hurt -- anyways it don't if she don't cry. Jim, I'll give
TOM you a marvel. I'll give you a white alley!''
TOM 
TOM Jim began to waver.
TOM 
TOM ``White alley, Jim! And it's a bully taw.''
TOM 
TOM ``My! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I's powerful
TOM 'fraid ole missis --''
TOM 
TOM ``And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe.''
TOM 
TOM Jim was only human -- this attraction was too much for him. He put down
TOM his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing
TOM interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was
TOM flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was
TOM whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with
TOM a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.
TOM But Tom's energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had
TOM planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys
TOM would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and
TOM they would make a world of fun of him for having to work -- the very
TOM thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and
TOM examined it -- bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an
TOM exchange of WORK, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an
TOM hour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket,
TOM and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and
TOM hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a
TOM great, magnificent inspiration.
TOM 
TOM He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in
TOM sight presently -- the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been
TOM dreading. Ben's gait was the hop-skip-and-jump -- proof enough that his
TOM heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and
TOM giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned
TOM ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As
TOM he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned
TOM far over to star-board and rounded to ponderously and with laborious
TOM pomp and circumstance -- for he was personating the Big Missouri, and
TOM considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and
TOM captain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing
TOM on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:
TOM 
TOM ``Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!'' The headway ran almost out, and he
TOM drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.
TOM 
TOM ``Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!'' His arms straightened and
TOM stiffened down his sides.
TOM 
TOM ``Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!
TOM Chow!'' His right hand, meantime, describing stately circles -- for it
TOM was representing a forty-foot wheel.
TOM 
TOM ``Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling!
TOM Chow-ch-chow-chow!'' The left hand began to describe circles.
TOM 
TOM ``Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on
TOM the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow!
TOM Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! LIVELY now! Come
TOM -- out with your spring-line -- what're you about there! Take a turn
TOM round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now -- let
TOM her go! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH'T! S'H'T!
TOM SH'T!'' (trying the gauge-cocks).
TOM 
TOM Tom went on whitewashing -- paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben
TOM stared a moment and then said: ``Hi-YI! YOU'RE up a stump, ain't you!''
TOM 
TOM No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then
TOM he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as
TOM before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom's mouth watered for the
TOM apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:
TOM 
TOM ``Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?''
TOM 
TOM Tom wheeled suddenly and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Why, it's you, Ben! I warn't noticing.''
TOM 
TOM ``Say -- I'm going in a-swimming, I am. Don't you wish you could? But of
TOM course you'd druther WORK -- wouldn't you? Course you would!''
TOM 
TOM Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:
TOM 
TOM ``What do you call work?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, ain't THAT work?''
TOM 
TOM Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:
TOM 
TOM ``Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it suits Tom
TOM Sawyer.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you LIKE it?''
TOM 
TOM The brush continued to move.
TOM 
TOM ``Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a boy get a
TOM chance to whitewash a fence every day?''
TOM 
TOM That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom
TOM swept his brush daintily back and forth -- stepped back to note the
TOM effect -- added a touch here and there -- criticised the effect again --
TOM Ben watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and
TOM more absorbed. Presently he said:
TOM 
TOM ``Say, Tom, let ME whitewash a little.''
TOM 
TOM Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:
TOM 
TOM ``No -- no -- I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's
TOM awful particular about this fence -- right here on the street, you know
TOM -- but if it was the back fence I wouldn't mind and SHE wouldn't. Yes,
TOM she's awful particular about this fence; it's got to be done very
TOM careful; I reckon there ain't one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand,
TOM that can do it the way it's got to be done.''
TOM 
TOM ``No -- is that so? Oh come, now -- lemme just try. Only just a little
TOM -- I'd let YOU, if you was me, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly -- well, Jim wanted to
TOM do it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn't
TOM let Sid. Now don't you see how I'm fixed? If you was to tackle this
TOM fence and anything was to happen to it --''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say -- I'll give
TOM you the core of my apple.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, here -- No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard --''
TOM 
TOM ``I'll give you ALL of it!''
TOM 
TOM Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his
TOM heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the
TOM sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled
TOM his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more
TOM innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every
TOM little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time
TOM Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a
TOM kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in
TOM for a dead rat and a string to swing it with -- and so on, and so on,
TOM hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a
TOM poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in
TOM wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part
TOM of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool
TOM cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a
TOM glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six
TOM fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a
TOM dog-collar -- but no dog -- the handle of a knife, four pieces of
TOM orange-peel, and a dilapidated old window sash.
TOM 
TOM He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while -- plenty of company --
TOM and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn't run out
TOM of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.
TOM 
TOM Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He
TOM had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it --
TOM namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only
TOM necessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great
TOM and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have
TOM comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do, and
TOM that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And this
TOM would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or
TOM performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing
TOM Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who
TOM drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily
TOM line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable
TOM money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn
TOM it into work and then they would resign.
TOM 
TOM The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place
TOM in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to
TOM report.

TOM Chapter III
TOM 
TOM TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an open
TOM window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,
TOM breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer
TOM air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing murmur
TOM of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her knitting
TOM -- for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her lap. Her
TOM spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had thought
TOM that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at seeing him
TOM place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He said: ``Mayn't
TOM I go and play now, aunt?''
TOM 
TOM ``What, a'ready? How much have you done?''
TOM 
TOM ``It's all done, aunt.''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, don't lie to me -- I can't bear it.''
TOM 
TOM ``I ain't, aunt; it IS all done.''
TOM 
TOM Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for
TOM herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of
TOM Tom's statement true. When she found the entire fence whitewashed, and
TOM not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a
TOM streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She
TOM said:
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I never! There's no getting round it, you can work when you're a
TOM mind to, Tom.'' And then she diluted the compliment by adding, ``But
TOM it's powerful seldom you're a mind to, I'm bound to say. Well, go 'long
TOM and play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I'll tan you.''
TOM 
TOM She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him
TOM into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,
TOM along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat
TOM took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort. And
TOM while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he ``hooked'' a
TOM doughnut.
TOM 
TOM Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway
TOM that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and the
TOM air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a
TOM hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties
TOM and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,
TOM and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general
TOM thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at
TOM peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his
TOM black thread and getting him into trouble.
TOM 
TOM Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the
TOM back of his aunt's cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach
TOM of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the
TOM village, where two ``military'' companies of boys had met for conflict,
TOM according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these
TOM armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two
TOM great commanders did not condescend to fight in person -- that being
TOM better suited to the still smaller fry -- but sat together on an
TOM eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through
TOM aides-de-camp. Tom's army won a great victory, after a long and
TOM hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, the
TOM terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the
TOM necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and
TOM marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.
TOM 
TOM As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new
TOM girl in the garden -- a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow
TOM hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered
TOM pantalettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A
TOM certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a
TOM memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction; he
TOM had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor
TOM little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had
TOM confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest
TOM boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time
TOM she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is
TOM done.
TOM 
TOM He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had
TOM discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and
TOM began to ``show off'' in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to
TOM win her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;
TOM but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic
TOM performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending
TOM her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,
TOM grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a
TOM moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great
TOM sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right
TOM away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she
TOM disappeared.
TOM 
TOM The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and
TOM then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if
TOM he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.
TOM Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his
TOM nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,
TOM in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his
TOM bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped
TOM away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a
TOM minute -- only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next
TOM his heart -- or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted
TOM in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.
TOM 
TOM He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, ``showing
TOM off,'' as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom
TOM comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some
TOM window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode
TOM home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.
TOM 
TOM All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered
TOM ``what had got into the child.'' He took a good scolding about clodding
TOM Sid, and did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar
TOM under his aunt's very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:
TOM 
TOM ``Aunt, you don't whack Sid when he takes it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do. You'd be always into
TOM that sugar if I warn't watching you.''
TOM 
TOM Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity,
TOM reached for the sugar-bowl -- a sort of glorying over Tom which was
TOM wellnigh unbearable. But Sid's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and
TOM broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled
TOM his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a
TOM word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she
TOM asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be
TOM nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model ``catch it.'' He
TOM was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the
TOM old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of
TOM wrath from over her spectacles. He said to himself, ``Now it's coming!''
TOM And the next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was
TOM uplifted to strike again when Tom cried out:
TOM 
TOM ``Hold on, now, what 'er you belting ME for? -- Sid broke it!''
TOM 
TOM Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when
TOM she got her tongue again, she only said:
TOM 
TOM ``Umf! Well, you didn't get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some
TOM other audacious mischief when I wasn't around, like enough.''
TOM 
TOM Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something
TOM kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a
TOM confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.
TOM So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.
TOM Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart
TOM his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the
TOM consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice
TOM of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,
TOM through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured
TOM himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching
TOM one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and
TOM die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured
TOM himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and
TOM his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how
TOM her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back
TOM her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie
TOM there cold and white and make no sign -- a poor little sufferer, whose
TOM griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of
TOM these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke;
TOM and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked,
TOM and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to
TOM him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any
TOM worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too
TOM sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced
TOM in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit
TOM of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness
TOM out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.
TOM 
TOM He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate
TOM places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river
TOM invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated
TOM the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could
TOM only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the
TOM uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower.
TOM He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal
TOM felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she cry,
TOM and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and
TOM comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?
TOM This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he
TOM worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and
TOM varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing
TOM and departed in the darkness.
TOM 
TOM About half-past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted street to
TOM where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon
TOM his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of
TOM a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the
TOM fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under
TOM that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him
TOM down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his
TOM hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower. And
TOM thus he would die -- out in the cold world, with no shelter over his
TOM homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow,
TOM no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And
TOM thus SHE would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and
TOM oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would
TOM she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted,
TOM so untimely cut down?
TOM 
TOM The window went up, a maid-servant's discordant voice profaned the holy
TOM calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's remains!
TOM 
TOM The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz
TOM as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound
TOM as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the
TOM fence and shot away in the gloom.
TOM 
TOM Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his
TOM drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he
TOM had any dim idea of making any ``references to allusions,'' he thought
TOM better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom's eye.
TOM 
TOM Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental
TOM note of the omission.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter IV
TOM 
TOM THE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful
TOM village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family
TOM worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid
TOM courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of
TOM originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of
TOM the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.
TOM 
TOM Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to ``get his
TOM verses.'' Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his
TOM energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the
TOM Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.
TOM At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,
TOM but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human
TOM thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took
TOM his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the
TOM fog:
TOM 
TOM ``Blessed are the -- a -- a --''
TOM 
TOM ``Poor'' --
TOM 
TOM ``Yes -- poor; blessed are the poor -- a -- a --''
TOM 
TOM ``In spirit --''
TOM 
TOM ``In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they -- they --''
TOM 
TOM ``THEIRS --''
TOM 
TOM ``For THEIRS. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
TOM of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they -- they --''
TOM 
TOM ``Sh --''
TOM 
TOM ``For they -- a --''
TOM 
TOM ``S, H, A --''
TOM 
TOM ``For they S, H -- Oh, I don't know what it is!''
TOM 
TOM ``SHALL!''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, SHALL! for they shall -- for they shall -- a -- a -- shall mourn
TOM -- a-- a -- blessed are they that shall -- they that -- a -- they that
TOM shall mourn, for they shall -- a -- shall WHAT? Why don't you tell me,
TOM Mary? -- what do you want to be so mean for?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I'm not teasing you. I wouldn't
TOM do that. You must go and learn it again. Don't you be discouraged, Tom,
TOM you'll manage it -- and if you do, I'll give you something ever so nice.
TOM There, now, that's a good boy.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.''
TOM 
TOM ``Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it's nice, it is nice.''
TOM 
TOM ``You bet you that's so, Mary. All right, I'll tackle it again.''
TOM 
TOM And he did ``tackle it again'' -- and under the double pressure of
TOM curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he
TOM accomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new ``Barlow''
TOM knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that
TOM swept his system shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not
TOM cut anything, but it was a ``sure-enough'' Barlow, and there was
TOM inconceivable grandeur in that -- though where the Western boys ever got
TOM the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its
TOM injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom
TOM contrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on
TOM the bureau, when he was called off to dress for Sunday-school.
TOM 
TOM Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went
TOM outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he
TOM dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;
TOM poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen
TOM and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But
TOM Mary removed the towel and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Now ain't you ashamed, Tom. You mustn't be so bad. Water won't hurt
TOM you.''
TOM 
TOM Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he
TOM stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath
TOM and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut
TOM and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds
TOM and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from the
TOM towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped
TOM short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line
TOM there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in
TOM front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she
TOM was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of
TOM color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls
TOM wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately
TOM smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his
TOM hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his
TOM own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his
TOM clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years -- they
TOM were simply called his ``other clothes'' -- and so by that we know the
TOM size of his wardrobe. The girl ``put him to rights'' after he had
TOM dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned
TOM his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and
TOM crowned him with his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly
TOM improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked;
TOM for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that
TOM galled him. He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was
TOM blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and
TOM brought them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made
TOM to do everything he didn't want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:
TOM 
TOM ``Please, Tom -- that's a good boy.''
TOM 
TOM So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three
TOM children set out for Sunday-school -- a place that Tom hated with his
TOM whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.
TOM 
TOM Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church
TOM service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,
TOM and the other always remained too -- for stronger reasons. The church's
TOM high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;
TOM the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board
TOM tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step
TOM and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:
TOM 
TOM ``Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes.''
TOM 
TOM ``What'll you take for her?''
TOM 
TOM ``What'll you give?''
TOM 
TOM ``Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.''
TOM 
TOM ``Less see 'em.''
TOM 
TOM Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.
TOM Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some
TOM small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other boys
TOM as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or
TOM fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm of
TOM clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a
TOM quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,
TOM elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a
TOM boy's hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy
TOM turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear
TOM him say ``Ouch!'' and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom's whole
TOM class were of a pattern -- restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they
TOM came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly,
TOM but had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and
TOM each got his reward -- in small blue tickets, each with a passage of
TOM Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the
TOM recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged
TOM for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets
TOM the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in
TOM those easy times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the
TOM industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a
TOM Dore Bible? And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way -- it was
TOM the patient work of two years -- and a boy of German parentage had won
TOM four or five. He once recited three thousand verses without stopping;
TOM but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was
TOM little better than an idiot from that day forth -- a grievous misfortune
TOM for the school, for on great occasions, before company, the
TOM superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy come out
TOM and ``spread himself.'' Only the older pupils managed to keep their
TOM tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and
TOM so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy
TOM circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that
TOM day that on the spot every scholar's heart was fired with a fresh
TOM ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that Tom's
TOM mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but
TOM unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory
TOM and the eclat that came with it.
TOM 
TOM In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with a
TOM closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its
TOM leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent
TOM makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as
TOM necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer
TOM who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert --
TOM though why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of
TOM music is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a
TOM slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair;
TOM he wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears
TOM and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth
TOM -- a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the
TOM whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a
TOM spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had
TOM fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion of
TOM the day, like sleigh-runners -- an effect patiently and laboriously
TOM produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a
TOM wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very
TOM sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places in
TOM such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that
TOM unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar
TOM intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this
TOM fashion:
TOM 
TOM ``Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as
TOM you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There --
TOM that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see
TOM one little girl who is looking out of the window -- I am afraid she
TOM thinks I am out there somewhere -- perhaps up in one of the trees making
TOM a speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you
TOM how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces
TOM assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good.'' And
TOM so forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the
TOM oration. It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar
TOM to us all.
TOM 
TOM The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
TOM and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings
TOM and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of
TOM isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound
TOM ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters' voice, and the
TOM conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.
TOM 
TOM A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was
TOM more or less rare -- the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher,
TOM accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged
TOM gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless
TOM the latter's wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless
TOM and full of chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too -- he could
TOM not meet Amy Lawrence's eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But
TOM when he saw this small new-comer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a
TOM moment. The next moment he was ``showing off'' with all his might --
TOM cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces -- in a word, using every art
TOM that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause. His
TOM exaltation had but one alloy -- the memory of his humiliation in this
TOM angel's garden -- and that record in sand was fast washing out, under
TOM the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.
TOM 
TOM The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.
TOM Walters' speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The
TOM middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage -- no less a one
TOM than the county judge -- altogether the most august creation these
TOM children had ever looked upon -- and they wondered what kind of material
TOM he was made of -- and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half
TOM afraid he might, too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away --
TOM so he had travelled, and seen the world -- these very eyes had looked
TOM upon the county court-house -- which was said to have a tin roof. The
TOM awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive
TOM silence and the ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge
TOM Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went
TOM forward, to be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school.
TOM It would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:
TOM 
TOM ``Look at him, Jim! He's a going up there. Say -- look! he's a going to
TOM shake hands with him -- he IS shaking hands with him! By jings, don't
TOM you wish you was Jeff?''
TOM 
TOM Mr. Walters fell to ``showing off,'' with all sorts of official
TOM bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments,
TOM discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a
TOM target. The librarian ``showed off'' -- running hither and thither with
TOM his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that
TOM insect authority delights in. The young lady teachers ``showed off'' --
TOM bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty
TOM warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The
TOM young gentlemen teachers ``showed off'' with small scoldings and other
TOM little displays of authority and fine attention to discipline -- and
TOM most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up at the library,
TOM by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had to be done over
TOM again two or three times (with much seeming vexation). The little girls
TOM ``showed off'' in various ways, and the little boys ``showed off'' with
TOM such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of
TOM scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic
TOM judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his
TOM own grandeur -- for he was ``showing off,'' too.
TOM 
TOM There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters' ecstasy complete,
TOM and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.
TOM Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough -- he had
TOM been around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds,
TOM now, to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.
TOM 
TOM And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with
TOM nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a
TOM Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not
TOM expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But
TOM there was no getting around it -- here were the certified checks, and
TOM they were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place
TOM with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced
TOM from head-quarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and
TOM so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the
TOM judicial one's altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in
TOM place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy -- but those that
TOM suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they
TOM themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to
TOM Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.
TOM These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a
TOM guileful snake in the grass.
TOM 
TOM The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the
TOM superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked
TOM somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow's instinct taught him
TOM that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,
TOM perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two
TOM thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises -- a dozen would
TOM strain his capacity, without a doubt.
TOM 
TOM Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in her
TOM face -- but he wouldn't look. She wondered; then she was just a grain
TOM troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went -- came again; she watched;
TOM a furtive glance told her worlds -- and then her heart broke, and she
TOM was jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom
TOM most of all (she thought).
TOM 
TOM Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath
TOM would hardly come, his heart quaked -- partly because of the awful
TOM greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would
TOM have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The
TOM Judge put his hand on Tom's head and called him a fine little man, and
TOM asked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, no, not Tom -- it is --''
TOM 
TOM ``Thomas.''
TOM 
TOM ``Ah, that's it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That's very
TOM well. But you've another one I daresay, and you'll tell it to me, won't
TOM you?''
TOM 
TOM ``Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,'' said Walters, ``and say
TOM sir. You mustn't forget your manners.''
TOM 
TOM ``Thomas Sawyer -- sir.''
TOM 
TOM ``That's it! That's a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two
TOM thousand verses is a great many -- very, very great many. And you never
TOM can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is
TOM worth more than anything there is in the world; it's what makes great
TOM men and good men; you'll be a great man and a good man yourself, some
TOM day, Thomas, and then you'll look back and say, It's all owing to the
TOM precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood -- it's all owing to my
TOM dear teachers that taught me to learn -- it's all owing to the good
TOM superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a
TOM beautiful Bible -- a splendid elegant Bible -- to keep and have it all
TOM for my own, always -- it's all owing to right bringing up! That is what
TOM you will say, Thomas -- and you wouldn't take any money for those two
TOM thousand verses -- no indeed you wouldn't. And now you wouldn't mind
TOM telling me and this lady some of the things you've learned -- no, I know
TOM you wouldn't -- for we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no
TOM doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. Won't you tell us
TOM the names of the first two that were appointed?''
TOM 
TOM Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed, now,
TOM and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters' heart sank within him. He said to
TOM himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest
TOM question -- why DID the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up
TOM and say:
TOM 
TOM ``Answer the gentleman, Thomas -- don't be afraid.''
TOM 
TOM Tom still hung fire.
TOM 
TOM ``Now I know you'll tell me,'' said the lady. ``The names of the first
TOM two disciples were --''
TOM 
TOM ``DAVID AND GOLIAH!''
TOM 
TOM Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.
TOM

TOM Chapter V
TOM 
TOM ABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,
TOM and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The
TOM Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and
TOM occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt
TOM Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her -- Tom being placed
TOM next the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open
TOM window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd
TOM filed up the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better
TOM days; the mayor and his wife -- for they had a mayor there, among other
TOM unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair,
TOM smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill
TOM mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much
TOM the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could
TOM boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the
TOM new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by
TOM a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all
TOM the young clerks in town in a body -- for they had stood in the
TOM vestibule sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and
TOM simpering admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last
TOM of all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of
TOM his mother as if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to
TOM church, and was the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he
TOM was so good. And besides, he had been ``thrown up to them'' so much. His
TOM white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on
TOM Sundays -- accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon
TOM boys who had as snobs.
TOM 
TOM The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more, to
TOM warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the
TOM church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
TOM choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all
TOM through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,
TOM but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,
TOM and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in
TOM some foreign country.
TOM 
TOM The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a
TOM peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His
TOM voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a
TOM certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word
TOM and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:
TOM 
TOM Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry BEDS of ease, Whilst
TOM others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' BLOOD y seas?
TOM 
TOM He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church ``sociables'' he was
TOM always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies
TOM would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,
TOM and ``wall'' their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say,
TOM ``Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this
TOM mortal earth.''
TOM 
TOM After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a
TOM bulletin-board, and read off ``notices'' of meetings and societies and
TOM things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of
TOM doom -- a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in
TOM cities, away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less
TOM there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of
TOM it.
TOM 
TOM And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went
TOM into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the
TOM church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;
TOM for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United
TOM States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the
TOM President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed
TOM by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
TOM European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light
TOM and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
TOM withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a
TOM supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and
TOM favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
TOM grateful harvest of good. Amen.
TOM 
TOM There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.
TOM The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he
TOM only endured it -- if he even did that much. He was restive all through
TOM it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously -- for he
TOM was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman's
TOM regular route over it -- and when a little trifle of new matter was
TOM interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he
TOM considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer
TOM a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his
TOM spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its
TOM arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part
TOM company with the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to
TOM view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its
TOM body as if they had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as
TOM tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as
TOM sorely as Tom's hands itched to grab for it they did not dare -- he
TOM believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing
TOM while the prayer was going on. But with the closing sentence his hand
TOM began to curve and steal forward; and the instant the ``Amen'' was out
TOM the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the act and made him
TOM let it go.
TOM 
TOM The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an
TOM argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod --
TOM and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone
TOM and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be
TOM hardly worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after
TOM church he always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew
TOM anything else about the discourse. However, this time he was really
TOM interested for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving
TOM picture of the assembling together of the world's hosts at the
TOM millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a
TOM little child should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of
TOM the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the
TOM conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking
TOM nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself that he
TOM wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.
TOM 
TOM Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.
TOM Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was a
TOM large black beetle with formidable jaws -- a ``pinchbug,'' he called it.
TOM It was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to
TOM take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went
TOM floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went
TOM into the boy's mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,
TOM unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out
TOM of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in
TOM the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came
TOM idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet,
TOM weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the
TOM drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around
TOM it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew
TOM bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly
TOM snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy
TOM the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,
TOM and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent
TOM and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin
TOM descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,
TOM a flirt of the poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards
TOM away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators shook
TOM with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and
TOM handkerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and
TOM probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a
TOM craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on
TOM it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his
TOM fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at
TOM it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But
TOM he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a
TOM fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to
TOM the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the
TOM beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony
TOM and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so
TOM did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down
TOM the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the
TOM home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was
TOM but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of
TOM light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang
TOM into its master's lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of
TOM distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.
TOM 
TOM By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with
TOM suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. The
TOM discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all
TOM possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest
TOM sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of
TOM unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson
TOM had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole
TOM congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.
TOM 
TOM Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was
TOM some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety
TOM in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog
TOM should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in
TOM him to carry it off.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter VI
TOM 
TOM MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found
TOM him so -- because it began another week's slow suffering in school. He
TOM generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,
TOM it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.
TOM 
TOM Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was
TOM sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility.
TOM He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated
TOM again. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he
TOM began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew
TOM feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly
TOM he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This
TOM was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a ``starter,'' as he
TOM called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that
TOM argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought
TOM he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.
TOM Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing the
TOM doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or
TOM three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly
TOM drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.
TOM But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed well
TOM worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable
TOM spirit.
TOM 
TOM But Sid slept on unconscious.
TOM 
TOM Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.
TOM 
TOM No result from Sid.
TOM 
TOM Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then
TOM swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.
TOM 
TOM Sid snored on.
TOM 
TOM Tom was aggravated. He said, ``Sid, Sid!'' and shook him. This course
TOM worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then
TOM brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.
TOM Tom went on groaning. Sid said:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom! Say, Tom!'' [No response.] ``Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,
TOM Tom?'' And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.
TOM 
TOM Tom moaned out:
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, don't, Sid. Don't joggle me.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, what's the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.''
TOM 
TOM ``No -- never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call
TOM anybody.''
TOM 
TOM ``But I must! DON'T groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you been this
TOM way?''
TOM 
TOM ``Hours. Ouch! Oh, don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me.''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, why didn't you wake me sooner ? Oh, Tom, DON'T! It makes my flesh
TOM crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?''
TOM 
TOM ``I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you've ever done to
TOM me. When I'm gone --''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Tom, you ain't dying, are you? Don't, Tom -- oh, don't. Maybe --''
TOM 
TOM ``I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell 'em so, Sid. And Sid, you give
TOM my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that's come to
TOM town, and tell her --''
TOM 
TOM But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality,
TOM now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had
TOM gathered quite a genuine tone.
TOM 
TOM Sid flew down-stairs and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom's dying!''
TOM 
TOM ``Dying!''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes'm. Don't wait -- come quick!''
TOM 
TOM ``Rubbage! I don't believe it!''
TOM 
TOM But she fled up-stairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.
TOM And her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the
TOM bed-side she gasped out:
TOM 
TOM ``You, Tom! Tom, what's the matter with you?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, auntie, I'm --''
TOM 
TOM ``What's the matter with you -- what is the matter with you, child?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!''
TOM 
TOM The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a
TOM little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and
TOM climb out of this.''
TOM 
TOM The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a
TOM little foolish, and he said:
TOM 
TOM ``Aunt Polly, it SEEMED mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my
TOM tooth at all.''
TOM 
TOM ``Your tooth, indeed! What's the matter with your tooth?''
TOM 
TOM ``One of them's loose, and it aches perfectly awful.''
TOM 
TOM ``There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.
TOM Well -- your tooth IS loose, but you're not going to die about that.
TOM Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.''
TOM 
TOM Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish
TOM I may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't want to stay
TOM home from school.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you thought
TOM you'd get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love
TOM you so, and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with
TOM your outrageousness.'' By this time the dental instruments were ready.
TOM The old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom's tooth with a
TOM loop and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of
TOM fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy's face. The tooth hung
TOM dangling by the bedpost, now.
TOM 
TOM But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after
TOM breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his
TOM upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable
TOM way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;
TOM and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and
TOM homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,
TOM and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain
TOM which he did not feel that it wasn't anything to spit like Tom Sawyer;
TOM but another boy said, ``Sour grapes!'' and he wandered away a dismantled
TOM hero.
TOM 
TOM Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry
TOM Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and
TOM dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless
TOM and vulgar and bad -- and because all their children admired him so, and
TOM delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like
TOM him. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied
TOM Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders not
TOM to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.
TOM Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown
TOM men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat
TOM was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,
TOM when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons
TOM far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of
TOM the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged
TOM in the dirt when not rolled up.
TOM 
TOM Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps
TOM in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to
TOM school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could
TOM go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it
TOM suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he
TOM pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring
TOM and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor
TOM put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything
TOM that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed,
TOM hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.
TOM 
TOM Tom hailed the romantic outcast:
TOM 
TOM ``Hello, Huckleberry!''
TOM 
TOM ``Hello yourself, and see how you like it.''
TOM 
TOM ``What's that you got?''
TOM 
TOM ``Dead cat.''
TOM 
TOM ``Lemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get him ?''
TOM 
TOM ``Bought him off'n a boy.''
TOM 
TOM ``What did you give?''
TOM 
TOM ``I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the
TOM slaughter-house.''
TOM 
TOM ``Where'd you get the blue ticket?''
TOM 
TOM ``Bought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.''
TOM 
TOM ``Say -- what is dead cats good for, Huck?''
TOM 
TOM ``Good for? Cure warts with.''
TOM 
TOM ``No! Is that so? I know something that's better.''
TOM 
TOM ``I bet you don't. What is it?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, spunk-water.''
TOM 
TOM ``Spunk-water! I wouldn't give a dern for spunk-water.''
TOM 
TOM ``You wouldn't, wouldn't you? D'you ever try it?''
TOM 
TOM ``No, I hain't. But Bob Tanner did.''
TOM 
TOM ``Who told you so!''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny
TOM told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the
TOM nigger told me. There now!''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, what of it? They'll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I
TOM don't know HIM. But I never see a nigger that WOULDN'T lie. Shucks! Now
TOM you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the
TOM rain-water was.''
TOM 
TOM ``In the daytime?''
TOM 
TOM ``Certainly.''
TOM 
TOM ``With his face to the stump?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes. Least I reckon so.''
TOM 
TOM ``Did he say anything?''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't reckon he did. I don't know.''
TOM 
TOM ``Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame
TOM fool way as that! Why, that ain't a-going to do any good. You got to go
TOM all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there's a
TOM spunk-water stump, and just as it's midnight you back up against the
TOM stump and jam your hand in and say:
TOM 
TOM 'Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water,
TOM swaller these warts,'
TOM 
TOM and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then
TOM turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.
TOM Because if you speak the charm's busted.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob Tanner
TOM done.''
TOM 
TOM ``No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in this
TOM town; and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to work
TOM spunk-water. I've took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,
TOM Huck. I play with frogs so much that I've always got considerable many
TOM warts. Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, bean's good. I've done that.''
TOM 
TOM ``Have you? What's your way?''
TOM 
TOM ``You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,
TOM and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a
TOM hole and bury it 'bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the
TOM moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece
TOM that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to
TOM fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the
TOM wart, and pretty soon off she comes.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, that's it, Huck -- that's it; though when you're burying it if
TOM you say 'Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!' it's better.
TOM That's the way Joe Harper does, and he's been nearly to Coonville and
TOM most everywheres. But say -- how do you cure 'em with dead cats?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard 'long about
TOM midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it's
TOM midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can't see
TOM 'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear 'em talk;
TOM and when they're taking that feller away, you heave your cat after 'em
TOM and say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I'm
TOM done with ye!' That'll fetch ANY wart.''
TOM 
TOM ``Sounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?''
TOM 
TOM ``No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a witch.''
TOM 
TOM ``Say! Why, Tom, I KNOW she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own
TOM self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he
TOM took up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged, he'd a got her. Well, that
TOM very night he rolled off'n a shed wher' he was a layin drunk, and broke
TOM his arm.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, that's awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?''
TOM 
TOM ``Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right
TOM stiddy, they're a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when
TOM they mumble they're saying the Lord's Prayer backards.''
TOM 
TOM ``Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?''
TOM 
TOM ``To-night. I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.''
TOM 
TOM ``But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday night?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight? -- and
TOM THEN it's Sunday. Devils don't slosh around much of a Sunday, I don't
TOM reckon.''
TOM 
TOM ``I never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?''
TOM 
TOM ``Of course -- if you ain't afeard.''
TOM 
TOM ``Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes -- and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep' me
TOM a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says
TOM 'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick through his window -- but don't
TOM you tell.''
TOM 
TOM ``I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but
TOM I'll meow this time. Say -- what's that?''
TOM 
TOM ``Nothing but a tick.''
TOM 
TOM ``Where'd you get him?''
TOM 
TOM ``Out in the woods.''
TOM 
TOM ``What'll you take for him?''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't know. I don't want to sell him.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right. It's a mighty small tick, anyway.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don't belong to them. I'm
TOM satisfied with it. It's a good enough tick for me.''
TOM 
TOM ``Sho, there's ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of 'em if I
TOM wanted to.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, why don't you? Becuz you know mighty well you can't. This is a
TOM pretty early tick, I reckon. It's the first one I've seen this year.''
TOM 
TOM ``Say, Huck -- I'll give you my tooth for him.''
TOM 
TOM ``Less see it.''
TOM 
TOM Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed
TOM it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:
TOM 
TOM ``Is it genuwyne?''
TOM 
TOM Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.
TOM 
TOM ``Well, all right,'' said Huckleberry, ``it's a trade.''
TOM 
TOM Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the
TOM pinchbug's prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than
TOM before.
TOM 
TOM When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in
TOM briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He
TOM hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like
TOM alacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom
TOM arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The
TOM interruption roused him.
TOM 
TOM ``Thomas Sawyer!''
TOM 
TOM Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.
TOM 
TOM ``Sir!''
TOM 
TOM ``Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?''
TOM 
TOM Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of
TOM yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric
TOM sympathy of love; and by that form was THE ONLY VACANT PLACE on the
TOM girls' side of the school-house. He instantly said:
TOM 
TOM ``I STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN!''
TOM 
TOM The master's pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of
TOM study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his
TOM mind. The master said:
TOM 
TOM ``You -- you did what?''
TOM 
TOM ``Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.''
TOM 
TOM There was no mistaking the words.
TOM 
TOM ``Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever
TOM listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your
TOM jacket.''
TOM 
TOM The master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches
TOM notably diminished. Then the order followed:
TOM 
TOM ``Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to
TOM you.''
TOM 
TOM The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but
TOM in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of
TOM his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good
TOM fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched
TOM herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and
TOM whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the
TOM long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.
TOM 
TOM By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur
TOM rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal
TOM furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, ``made a mouth'' at him
TOM and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she
TOM cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it
TOM away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less
TOM animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it
TOM remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, ``Please take it -- I got more.'' The
TOM girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw
TOM something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time
TOM the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began to
TOM manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,
TOM apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt to
TOM see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she
TOM gave in and hesitatingly whispered:
TOM 
TOM ``Let me see it.''
TOM 
TOM Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends
TOM to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl's
TOM interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything
TOM else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:
TOM 
TOM ``It's nice -- make a man.''
TOM 
TOM The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He
TOM could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;
TOM she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:
TOM 
TOM ``It's a beautiful man -- now make me coming along.''
TOM 
TOM Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed
TOM the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:
TOM 
TOM ``It's ever so nice -- I wish I could draw.''
TOM 
TOM ``It's easy,'' whispered Tom, ``I'll learn you.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, will you? When?''
TOM 
TOM ``At noon. Do you go home to dinner?''
TOM 
TOM ``I'll stay if you will.''
TOM 
TOM ``Good -- that's a whack. What's your name?''
TOM 
TOM ``Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas Sawyer.''
TOM 
TOM ``That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You call me
TOM Tom, will you?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes.''
TOM 
TOM Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from
TOM the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom
TOM said:
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, it ain't anything.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes it is.''
TOM 
TOM ``No it ain't. You don't want to see.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.''
TOM 
TOM ``You'll tell.''
TOM 
TOM ``No I won't -- deed and deed and double deed won't.''
TOM 
TOM ``You won't tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?''
TOM 
TOM ``No, I won't ever tell ANYbody. Now let me.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, YOU don't want to see!''
TOM 
TOM ``Now that you treat me so, I WILL see.'' And she put her small hand
TOM upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in
TOM earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were
TOM revealed: ``I LOVE YOU.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, you bad thing!'' And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened
TOM and looked pleased, nevertheless.
TOM 
TOM Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his
TOM ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that vise he was borne across the
TOM house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles
TOM from the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful
TOM moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But
TOM although Tom's ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.
TOM 
TOM As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but the
TOM turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the
TOM reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and
TOM turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into
TOM continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and
TOM got ``turned down,'' by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought
TOM up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with
TOM ostentation for months.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter VII
TOM 
TOM THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas
TOM wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed
TOM to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.
TOM There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.
TOM The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the
TOM soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the
TOM flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a
TOM shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds
TOM floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible
TOM but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom's heart ached to be free, or
TOM else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time. His
TOM hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of
TOM gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively the
TOM percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on the
TOM long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that
TOM amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when
TOM he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and
TOM made him take a new direction.
TOM 
TOM Tom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and now
TOM he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an
TOM instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn
TOM friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a pin
TOM out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner. The
TOM sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were
TOM interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit of
TOM the tick. So he put Joe's slate on the desk and drew a line down the
TOM middle of it from top to bottom.
TOM 
TOM ``Now,'' said he, ``as long as he is on your side you can stir him up
TOM and I'll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,
TOM you're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing
TOM over.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right, go ahead; start him up.''
TOM 
TOM The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe
TOM harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This
TOM change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with
TOM absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the
TOM two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all
TOM things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick
TOM tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as
TOM anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have
TOM victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would be
TOM twitching to begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep
TOM possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too
TOM strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in
TOM a moment. Said he:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, you let him alone.''
TOM 
TOM ``I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.''
TOM 
TOM ``No, sir, it ain't fair; you just let him alone.''
TOM 
TOM ``Blame it, I ain't going to stir him much.''
TOM 
TOM ``Let him alone, I tell you.''
TOM 
TOM ``I won't!''
TOM 
TOM ``You shall -- he's on my side of the line.''
TOM 
TOM ``Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't care whose tick he is -- he's on my side of the line, and you
TOM sha'n't touch him.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I'll just bet I will, though. He's my tick and I'll do what I
TOM blame please with him, or die!''
TOM 
TOM A tremendous whack came down on Tom's shoulders, and its duplicate on
TOM Joe's; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from
TOM the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been too
TOM absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile
TOM before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.
TOM He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed
TOM his bit of variety to it.
TOM 
TOM When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered
TOM in her ear:
TOM 
TOM ``Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you get to
TOM the corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down through the
TOM lane and come back. I'll go the other way and come it over 'em the same
TOM way.''
TOM 
TOM So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with
TOM another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and
TOM when they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they
TOM sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil
TOM and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising
TOM house. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.
TOM Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:
TOM 
TOM ``Do you love rats?''
TOM 
TOM ``No! I hate them!''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I do, too -- LIVE ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round
TOM your head with a string.''
TOM 
TOM ``No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.''
TOM 
TOM ``Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you must give
TOM it back to me.''
TOM 
TOM That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs
TOM against the bench in excess of contentment.
TOM 
TOM ``Was you ever at a circus?'' said Tom.
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, and my pa's going to take me again some time, if I'm good.''
TOM 
TOM ``I been to the circus three or four times -- lots of times. Church
TOM ain't shucks to a circus. There's things going on at a circus all the
TOM time. I'm going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, are you! That will be nice. They're so lovely, all spotted up.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, that's so. And they get slathers of money -- most a dollar a day,
TOM Ben Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?''
TOM 
TOM ``What's that?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, engaged to be married.''
TOM 
TOM ``No.''
TOM 
TOM ``Would you like to?''
TOM 
TOM ``I reckon so. I don't know. What is it like?''
TOM 
TOM ``Like? Why it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy you won't
TOM ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that's
TOM all. Anybody can do it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Kiss? What do you kiss for?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, that, you know, is to -- well, they always do that.''
TOM 
TOM ``Everybody?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, yes, everybody that's in love with each other. Do you remember
TOM what I wrote on the slate?''
TOM 
TOM ``Ye -- yes.''
TOM 
TOM ``What was it?''
TOM 
TOM ``I sha'n't tell you.''
TOM 
TOM ``Shall I tell YOU?''
TOM 
TOM ``Ye -- yes -- but some other time.''
TOM 
TOM ``No, now.''
TOM 
TOM ``No, not now -- to-morrow.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, no, NOW. Please, Becky -- I'll whisper it, I'll whisper it ever so
TOM easy.''
TOM 
TOM Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about
TOM her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to
TOM her ear. And then he added:
TOM 
TOM ``Now you whisper it to me -- just the same.''
TOM 
TOM She resisted, for a while, and then said:
TOM 
TOM ``You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But you
TOM mustn't ever tell anybody -- WILL you, Tom? Now you won't, WILL you?''
TOM 
TOM ``No, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky.''
TOM 
TOM He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred
TOM his curls and whispered, ``I -- love -- you!''
TOM 
TOM Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,
TOM with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little
TOM white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:
TOM 
TOM ``Now, Becky, it's all done -- all over but the kiss. Don't you be
TOM afraid of that -- it ain't anything at all. Please, Becky.'' And he
TOM tugged at her apron and the hands.
TOM 
TOM By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing
TOM with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and
TOM said:
TOM 
TOM ``Now it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain't
TOM ever to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to marry anybody but me,
TOM ever never and forever. Will you?''
TOM 
TOM ``No, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never marry anybody
TOM but you -- and you ain't to ever marry anybody but me, either.''
TOM 
TOM ``Certainly. Of course. That's PART of it. And always coming to school
TOM or when we're going home, you're to walk with me, when there ain't
TOM anybody looking -- and you choose me and I choose you at parties,
TOM because that's the way you do when you're engaged.''
TOM 
TOM ``It's so nice. I never heard of it before.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, it's ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence --''
TOM 
TOM The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Tom! Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to!''
TOM 
TOM The child began to cry. Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, don't cry, Becky, I don't care for her any more.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, you do, Tom -- you know you do.''
TOM 
TOM Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and
TOM turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with
TOM soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was
TOM up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and
TOM uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping
TOM she would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began to
TOM feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle
TOM with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and
TOM entered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with
TOM her face to the wall. Tom's heart smote him. He went to her and stood a
TOM moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:
TOM 
TOM ``Becky, I -- I don't care for anybody but you.''
TOM 
TOM No reply -- but sobs.
TOM 
TOM ``Becky'' -- pleadingly. ``Becky, won't you say something?''
TOM 
TOM More sobs.
TOM 
TOM Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron,
TOM and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Please, Becky, won't you take it?''
TOM 
TOM She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over
TOM the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently
TOM Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she
TOM flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom! Come back, Tom!''
TOM 
TOM She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions
TOM but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid
TOM herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she
TOM had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross
TOM of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about
TOM her to exchange sorrows with.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter VIII
TOM 
TOM TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the
TOM track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed
TOM a small ``branch'' two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile
TOM superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later he
TOM was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff
TOM Hill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the
TOM valley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to
TOM the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.
TOM There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even
TOM stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken
TOM by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and
TOM this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the
TOM more profound. The boy's soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings
TOM were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows
TOM on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him
TOM that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy
TOM Hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie
TOM and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through
TOM the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and
TOM nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a
TOM clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with
TOM it all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant the
TOM best in the world, and been treated like a dog -- like a very dog. She
TOM would be sorry some day -- maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could
TOM only die TEMPORARILY!
TOM 
TOM But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained
TOM shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into
TOM the concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and
TOM disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away -- ever so far away, into
TOM unknown countries beyond the seas -- and never came back any more! How
TOM would she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only
TOM to fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights
TOM were an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was
TOM exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be a
TOM soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious. No
TOM -- better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on
TOM the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the
TOM Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with
TOM feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy
TOM summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs
TOM of all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was
TOM something gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it! NOW
TOM his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable splendor.
TOM How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder! How
TOM gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,
TOM black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying
TOM at the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear
TOM at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in
TOM his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson
TOM sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass at
TOM his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,
TOM with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy the
TOM whisperings, ``It's Tom Sawyer the Pirate! -- the Black Avenger of the
TOM Spanish Main!''
TOM 
TOM Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from
TOM home and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore
TOM he must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.
TOM He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of
TOM it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He
TOM put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:
TOM 
TOM ``What hasn't come here, come! What's here, stay here!''
TOM 
TOM Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it up
TOM and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides
TOM were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom's astonishment was boundless!
TOM He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Well, that beats anything!''
TOM 
TOM Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The
TOM truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and all
TOM his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried a
TOM marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a
TOM fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just
TOM used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered
TOM themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been
TOM separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.
TOM Tom's whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had
TOM many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing
TOM before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times
TOM before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He
TOM puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch
TOM had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself
TOM on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot
TOM with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and
TOM put his mouth close to this depression and called --
TOM 
TOM ``Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,
TOM doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!''
TOM 
TOM The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a
TOM second and then darted under again in a fright.
TOM 
TOM ``He dasn't tell! So it WAS a witch that done it. I just knowed it.''
TOM 
TOM He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he
TOM gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have
TOM the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a
TOM patient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his
TOM treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing
TOM when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his
TOM pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:
TOM 
TOM ``Brother, go find your brother!''
TOM 
TOM He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must have
TOM fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last
TOM repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each
TOM other.
TOM 
TOM Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green
TOM aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned a
TOM suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,
TOM disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and in
TOM a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged, with
TOM fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an
TOM answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way
TOM and that. He said cautiously -- to an imaginary company:
TOM 
TOM ``Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.''
TOM 
TOM Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.
TOM Tom called:
TOM 
TOM ``Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?''
TOM 
TOM ``Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou that -- that --''
TOM 
TOM ``Dares to hold such language,'' said Tom, prompting -- for they talked
TOM ``by the book,'' from memory.
TOM 
TOM ``Who art thou that dares to hold such language?''
TOM 
TOM ``I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.''
TOM 
TOM ``Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute
TOM with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!''
TOM 
TOM They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,
TOM struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful
TOM combat, ``two up and two down.'' Presently Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``Now, if you've got the hang, go it lively!''
TOM 
TOM So they ``went it lively,'' panting and perspiring with the work. By and
TOM by Tom shouted:
TOM 
TOM ``Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?''
TOM 
TOM ``I sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the worst of
TOM it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it is in
TOM the book. The book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor
TOM Guy of Guisborne.' You're to turn around and let me hit you in the
TOM back.''
TOM 
TOM There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the
TOM whack and fell.
TOM 
TOM ``Now,'' said Joe, getting up, ``you got to let me kill YOU. That's
TOM fair.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, it's blamed mean -- that's all.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son, and
TOM lam me with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and
TOM you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me.''
TOM 
TOM This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then
TOM Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to
TOM bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,
TOM representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,
TOM gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, ``Where this arrow
TOM falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.'' Then he
TOM shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle
TOM and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.
TOM 
TOM The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off
TOM grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern
TOM civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss. They
TOM said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than
TOM President of the United States forever.

TOM Chapter IX
TOM 
TOM AT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.
TOM They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and
TOM waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be
TOM nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He
TOM would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was
TOM afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.
TOM Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,
TOM scarcely preceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking
TOM of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack
TOM mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad.
TOM A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly's chamber. And now the
TOM tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,
TOM began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the
TOM bed's head made Tom shudder -- it meant that somebody's days were
TOM numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was
TOM answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony.
TOM At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he
TOM began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did
TOM not hear it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams,
TOM a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window
TOM disturbed him. A cry of ``Scat! you devil!'' and the crash of an empty
TOM bottle against the back of his aunt's woodshed brought him wide awake,
TOM and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and
TOM creeping along the roof of the ``ell'' on all fours. He ``meow'd'' with
TOM caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the
TOM woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his
TOM dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of
TOM half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.
TOM 
TOM It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,
TOM about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence
TOM around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the
TOM time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the
TOM whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a
TOM tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over
TOM the graves, leaning for support and finding none. ``Sacred to the memory
TOM of'' So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer
TOM have been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.
TOM 
TOM A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the
TOM spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked
TOM little, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the
TOM pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the
TOM sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the
TOM protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of
TOM the grave.
TOM 
TOM Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of
TOM a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom's
TOM reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a
TOM whisper:
TOM 
TOM ``Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?''
TOM 
TOM Huckleberry whispered:
TOM 
TOM ``I wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, AIN'T it?''
TOM 
TOM ``I bet it is.''
TOM 
TOM There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter
TOM inwardly. Then Tom whispered:
TOM 
TOM ``Say, Hucky -- do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?''
TOM 
TOM ``O' course he does. Least his sperrit does.''
TOM 
TOM Tom, after a pause:
TOM 
TOM ``I wish I'd said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody
TOM calls him Hoss.''
TOM 
TOM ``A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead
TOM people, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM This was a damper, and conversation died again.
TOM 
TOM Presently Tom seized his comrade's arm and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Sh!''
TOM 
TOM ``What is it, Tom?'' And the two clung together with beating hearts.
TOM 
TOM ``Sh! There 'tis again! Didn't you hear it?''
TOM 
TOM ``I --''
TOM 
TOM ``There! Now you hear it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Lord, Tom, they're coming! They're coming, sure. What'll we do?''
TOM 
TOM ``I dono. Think they'll see us?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn't
TOM come.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, don't be afeard. I don't believe they'll bother us. We ain't doing
TOM any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won't notice us at
TOM all.''
TOM 
TOM ``I'll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I'm all of a shiver.''
TOM 
TOM ``Listen!''
TOM 
TOM The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled
TOM sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.
TOM 
TOM ``Look! See there!'' whispered Tom. ``What is it?''
TOM 
TOM ``It's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.''
TOM 
TOM Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an
TOM old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable
TOM little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a
TOM shudder:
TOM 
TOM ``It's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're goners!
TOM Can you pray?''
TOM 
TOM ``I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us. 'Now I
TOM lay me down to sleep, I --'''
TOM 
TOM ``Sh!''
TOM 
TOM ``What is it, Huck?''
TOM 
TOM ``They're HUMANS! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old Muff Potter's
TOM voice.''
TOM 
TOM ``No -- 'tain't so, is it?''
TOM 
TOM ``I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp enough to
TOM notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely -- blamed old rip!''
TOM 
TOM ``All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it. Here
TOM they come again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot!
TOM They're p'inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o' them
TOM voices; it's Injun Joe.''
TOM 
TOM ``That's so -- that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was devils a
TOM dern sight. What kin they be up to?''
TOM 
TOM The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the
TOM grave and stood within a few feet of the boys' hiding-place.
TOM 
TOM ``Here it is,'' said the third voice; and the owner of it held the
TOM lantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.
TOM 
TOM Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple
TOM of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave.
TOM The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat
TOM down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the
TOM boys could have touched him.
TOM 
TOM ``Hurry, men!'' he said, in a low voice; ``the moon might come out at
TOM any moment.''
TOM 
TOM They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no
TOM noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of
TOM mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon
TOM the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two
TOM the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with
TOM their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The
TOM moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face. The
TOM barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a
TOM blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large
TOM spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:
TOM 
TOM ``Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out with
TOM another five, or here she stays.''
TOM 
TOM ``That's the talk!'' said Injun Joe.
TOM 
TOM ``Look here, what does this mean?'' said the doctor. ``You required your
TOM pay in advance, and I've paid you.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, and you done more than that,'' said Injun Joe, approaching the
TOM doctor, who was now standing. ``Five years ago you drove me away from
TOM your father's kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to
TOM eat, and you said I warn't there for any good; and when I swore I'd get
TOM even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for
TOM a vagrant. Did you think I'd forget? The Injun blood ain't in me for
TOM nothing. And now I've GOT you, and you got to SETTLE, you know!''
TOM 
TOM He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.
TOM The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.
TOM Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:
TOM 
TOM ``Here, now, don't you hit my pard!'' and the next moment he had
TOM grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and
TOM main, trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun
TOM Joe sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up
TOM Potter's knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round
TOM about the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor
TOM flung himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams' grave and
TOM felled Potter to the earth with it -- and in the same instant the
TOM half-breed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young
TOM man's breast. He reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with
TOM his blood, and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful
TOM spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.
TOM 
TOM Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the
TOM two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave
TOM a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:
TOM 
TOM ``THAT score is settled -- damn you.''
TOM 
TOM Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter's
TOM open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three -- four --
TOM five minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand
TOM closed upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall,
TOM with a shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at
TOM it, and then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe's.
TOM 
TOM ``Lord, how is this, Joe?'' he said.
TOM 
TOM ``It's a dirty business,'' said Joe, without moving.
TOM 
TOM ``What did you do it for?''
TOM 
TOM ``I! I never done it!''
TOM 
TOM ``Look here! That kind of talk won't wash.''
TOM 
TOM Potter trembled and grew white.
TOM 
TOM ``I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But it's
TOM in my head yet -- worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a muddle;
TOM can't recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe -- HONEST, now, old
TOM feller -- did I do it? Joe, I never meant to -- 'pon my soul and honor,
TOM I never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it's awful -- and
TOM him so young and promising.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard
TOM and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering
TOM like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched
TOM you another awful clip -- and here you've laid, as dead as a wedge til
TOM now.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, I didn't know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if
TOM I did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I
TOM reckon. I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I've fought, but
TOM never with weepons. They'll all say that. Joe, don't tell! Say you won't
TOM tell, Joe -- that's a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up
TOM for you, too. Don't you remember? You WON'T tell, WILL you, Joe?'' And
TOM the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and
TOM clasped his appealing hands.
TOM 
TOM ``No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I
TOM won't go back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man can say.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest day I
TOM live.'' And Potter began to cry.
TOM 
TOM ``Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for blubbering.
TOM You be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and don't leave any
TOM tracks behind you.''
TOM 
TOM Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed
TOM stood looking after him. He muttered:
TOM 
TOM ``If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he
TOM had the look of being, he won't think of the knife till he's gone so far
TOM he'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself --
TOM chicken-heart!''
TOM 
TOM Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the
TOM lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the
TOM moon's. The stillness was complete again, too.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter X
TOM 
TOM THE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with horror.
TOM They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,
TOM apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump
TOM that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them
TOM catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay
TOM near the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give
TOM wings to their feet.
TOM 
TOM ``If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!''
TOM whispered Tom, in short catches between breaths. ``I can't stand it much
TOM longer.''
TOM 
TOM Huckleberry's hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed
TOM their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.
TOM They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst
TOM through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering
TOM shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:
TOM 
TOM ``Huckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?''
TOM 
TOM ``If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging'll come of it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Do you though?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, I KNOW it, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM Tom thought a while, then he said:
TOM 
TOM ``Who'll tell? We?''
TOM 
TOM ``What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun Joe
TOM DIDN'T hang? Why, he'd kill us some time or other, just as dead sure as
TOM we're a laying here.''
TOM 
TOM ``That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.''
TOM 
TOM ``If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough. He's
TOM generally drunk enough.''
TOM 
TOM Tom said nothing -- went on thinking. Presently he whispered:
TOM 
TOM ``Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?''
TOM 
TOM ``What's the reason he don't know it?''
TOM 
TOM ``Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you reckon
TOM he could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?''
TOM 
TOM ``By hokey, that's so, Tom!''
TOM 
TOM ``And besides, look-a-here -- maybe that whack done for HIM!''
TOM 
TOM ``No, 'taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and
TOM besides, he always has. Well, when pap's full, you might take and belt
TOM him over the head with a church and you couldn't phase him. He says so,
TOM his own self. So it's the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man
TOM was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.''
TOM 
TOM After another reflective silence, Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, we GOT to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn't make
TOM any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak
TOM 'bout this and they didn't hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take
TOM and swear to one another -- that's what we got to do -- swear to keep
TOM mum.''
TOM 
TOM ``I'm agreed. It's the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear
TOM that we --''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh no, that wouldn't do for this. That's good enough for little
TOM rubbishy common things -- specially with gals, cuz THEY go back on you
TOM anyway, and blab if they get in a huff -- but there orter be writing
TOM 'bout a big thing like this. And blood.''
TOM 
TOM Tom's whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;
TOM the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.
TOM He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a
TOM little fragment of ``red keel'' out of his pocket, got the moon on his
TOM work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow
TOM down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the
TOM pressure on the up-strokes. [See next page.]
TOM 
TOM ``Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They
TOM wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.''
TOM 
TOM Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in writing, and
TOM the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and
TOM was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have verdigrease on
TOM it.''
TOM 
TOM ``What's verdigrease?''
TOM 
TOM ``It's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it once --
TOM you'll see.''
TOM 
TOM So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked
TOM the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after
TOM many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his
TOM little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and
TOM an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the
TOM wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters that
TOM bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown
TOM away.
TOM 
TOM A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined
TOM building, now, but they did not notice it.
TOM 
TOM ``Tom,'' whispered Huckleberry, ``does this keep us from EVER telling --
TOM ALWAYS?''
TOM 
TOM ``Of course it does. It don't make any difference WHAT happens, we got
TOM to keep mum. We'd drop down dead -- don't YOU know that?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, I reckon that's so.''
TOM 
TOM They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up a
TOM long, lugubrious howl just outside -- within ten feet of them. The boys
TOM clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.
TOM 
TOM ``Which of us does he mean?'' gasped Huckleberry.
TOM 
TOM ``I dono -- peep through the crack. Quick!''
TOM 
TOM ``No, YOU, Tom!''
TOM 
TOM ``I can't -- I can't DO it, Huck!''
TOM 
TOM ``Please, Tom. There 'tis again!''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!'' whispered Tom. ``I know his voice. It's
TOM Bull Harbison.'' *
TOM 
TOM [* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of
TOM him as ``Harbison's Bull,'' but a son or a dog of that name was ``Bull
TOM Harbison.'']
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, that's good -- I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I'd a
TOM bet anything it was a STRAY dog.''
TOM 
TOM The dog howled again. The boys' hearts sank once more.
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison!'' whispered Huckleberry. ``DO,
TOM Tom!''
TOM 
TOM Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His
TOM whisper was hardly audible when he said:
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Huck, IT S A STRAY DOG!''
TOM 
TOM ``Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?''
TOM 
TOM ``Huck, he must mean us both -- we're right together.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no mistake 'bout
TOM where I'LL go to. I been so wicked.''
TOM 
TOM ``Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a
TOM feller's told NOT to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a tried
TOM -- but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if ever I get off this time, I lay
TOM I'll just WALLER in Sunday-schools!'' And Tom began to snuffle a little.
TOM 
TOM ``YOU bad!'' and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. ``Consound it, Tom
TOM Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'longside o' what I am. Oh, LORDY, lordy,
TOM lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.''
TOM 
TOM Tom choked off and whispered:
TOM 
TOM ``Look, Hucky, look! He's got his BACK to us!''
TOM 
TOM Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.
TOM 
TOM ``Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you
TOM know. NOW who can he mean?''
TOM 
TOM The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.
TOM 
TOM ``Sh! What's that?'' he whispered.
TOM 
TOM ``Sounds like -- like hogs grunting. No -- it's somebody snoring, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``That IS it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?''
TOM 
TOM ``I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to
TOM sleep there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just
TOM lifts things when HE snores. Besides, I reckon he ain't ever coming back
TOM to this town any more.''
TOM 
TOM The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.
TOM 
TOM ``Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!''
TOM 
TOM Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
TOM boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their
TOM heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down,
TOM the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the
TOM snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man
TOM moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was
TOM Muff Potter. The boys' hearts had stood still, and their hopes too, when
TOM the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tiptoed out,
TOM through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance to
TOM exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night
TOM air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few
TOM feet of where Potter was lying, and FACING Potter, with his nose
TOM pointing heavenward.
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, geeminy, it's HIM!'' exclaimed both boys, in a breath.
TOM 
TOM ``Say, Tom -- they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller's
TOM house, 'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come
TOM in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there
TOM ain't anybody dead there yet.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie Miller fall
TOM in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, but she ain't DEAD. And what's more, she's getting better, too.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure as Muff
TOM Potter's a goner. That's what the niggers say, and they know all about
TOM these kind of things, Huck.''
TOM 
TOM Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window
TOM the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and
TOM fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He
TOM was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for
TOM an hour.
TOM 
TOM When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the
TOM light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not
TOM been called -- persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled
TOM him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,
TOM feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had
TOM finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted
TOM eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to
TOM the culprit's heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it was
TOM up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into
TOM silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.
TOM 
TOM After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in
TOM the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt
TOM wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;
TOM and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs
TOM with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.
TOM This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom's heart was sorer now
TOM than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform
TOM over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that he
TOM had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble
TOM confidence.
TOM 
TOM He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward Sid;
TOM and so the latter's prompt retreat through the back gate was
TOM unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,
TOM along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the air
TOM of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to
TOM trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his
TOM desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony
TOM stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go. His
TOM elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time he
TOM slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with a
TOM sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal
TOM sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!
TOM 
TOM This final feather broke the camel's back.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XI
TOM 
TOM CLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified
TOM with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet undreamed-of telegraph; the
TOM tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,
TOM with little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave
TOM holiday for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of him
TOM if he had not.
TOM 
TOM A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been
TOM recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter -- so the story ran.
TOM And it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing
TOM himself in the ``branch'' about one or two o'clock in the morning, and
TOM that Potter had at once sneaked off -- suspicious circumstances,
TOM especially the washing which was not a habit with Potter. It was also
TOM said that the town had been ransacked for this ``murderer'' (the public
TOM are not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a
TOM verdict), but that he could not be found. Horsemen had departed down all
TOM the roads in every direction, and the Sheriff ``was confident'' that he
TOM would be captured before night.
TOM 
TOM All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom's heartbreak
TOM vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not a
TOM thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,
TOM unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he
TOM wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle. It
TOM seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched his
TOM arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry's. Then both looked
TOM elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their
TOM mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly
TOM spectacle before them.
TOM 
TOM ``Poor fellow!'' ``Poor young fellow!'' ``This ought to be a lesson to
TOM grave robbers!'' ``Muff Potter'll hang for this if they catch him!''
TOM This was the drift of remark; and the minister said, ``It was a
TOM judgment; His hand is here.''
TOM 
TOM Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid
TOM face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,
TOM and voices shouted, ``It's him! it's him! he's coming himself!''
TOM 
TOM ``Who? Who?'' from twenty voices.
TOM 
TOM ``Muff Potter!''
TOM 
TOM ``Hallo, he's stopped! -- Look out, he's turning! Don't let him get
TOM away!''
TOM 
TOM People in the branches of the trees over Tom's head said he wasn't
TOM trying to get away -- he only looked doubtful and perplexed.
TOM 
TOM ``Infernal impudence!'' said a bystander; ``wanted to come and take a
TOM quiet look at his work, I reckon -- didn't expect any company.''
TOM 
TOM The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously
TOM leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow's face was haggard, and his
TOM eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the
TOM murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands
TOM and burst into tears.
TOM 
TOM ``I didn't do it, friends,'' he sobbed; ``'pon my word and honor I never
TOM done it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Who's accused you?'' shouted a voice.
TOM 
TOM This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around
TOM him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and
TOM exclaimed:
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you'd never --''
TOM 
TOM ``Is that your knife?'' and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.
TOM 
TOM Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the
TOM ground. Then he said:
TOM 
TOM ``Something told me 't if I didn't come back and get --'' He shuddered;
TOM then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, ``Tell
TOM 'em, Joe, tell 'em -- it ain't any use any more.''
TOM 
TOM Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the
TOM stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every
TOM moment that the clear sky would deliver God's lightnings upon his head,
TOM and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had
TOM finished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to
TOM break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner's life faded and
TOM vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and
TOM it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.
TOM 
TOM ``Why didn't you leave? What did you want to come here for?'' somebody
TOM said.
TOM 
TOM ``I couldn't help it -- I couldn't help it,'' Potter moaned. ``I wanted
TOM to run away, but I couldn't seem to come anywhere but here.'' And he
TOM fell to sobbing again.
TOM 
TOM Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes
TOM afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the
TOM lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that Joe
TOM had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most
TOM balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could
TOM not take their fascinated eyes from his face.
TOM 
TOM They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should
TOM offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.
TOM 
TOM Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in a
TOM wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd
TOM that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy
TOM circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were
TOM disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:
TOM 
TOM ``It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.''
TOM 
TOM Tom's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
TOM much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
TOM awake half the time.''
TOM 
TOM Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.
TOM 
TOM ``It's a bad sign,'' said Aunt Polly, gravely. ``What you got on your
TOM mind, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM ``Nothing. Nothing 't I know of.'' But the boy's hand shook so that he
TOM spilled his coffee.
TOM 
TOM ``And you do talk such stuff,'' Sid said. ``Last night you said, 'It's
TOM blood, it's blood, that's what it is!' You said that over and over. And
TOM you said, 'Don't torment me so -- I'll tell!' Tell WHAT? What is it
TOM you'll tell?''
TOM 
TOM Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have
TOM happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly's face
TOM and she came to Tom's relief without knowing it. She said:
TOM 
TOM ``Sho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night
TOM myself. Sometimes I dream it's me that done it.''
TOM 
TOM Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied.
TOM Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after
TOM that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every
TOM night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently
TOM slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good
TOM while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place
TOM again. Tom's distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew
TOM irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of
TOM Tom's disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.
TOM 
TOM It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding
TOM inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.
TOM Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries, though
TOM it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises; he
TOM noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness -- and that was strange;
TOM and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion
TOM to these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,
TOM but said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and
TOM ceased to torture Tom's conscience.
TOM 
TOM Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his
TOM opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such
TOM small comforts through to the ``murderer'' as he could get hold of. The
TOM jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge
TOM of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it was
TOM seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom's
TOM conscience.
TOM 
TOM The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride
TOM him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character
TOM that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the
TOM matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his
TOM inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery
TOM that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in
TOM the courts at present.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XII
TOM 
TOM ONE of the reasons why Tom's mind had drifted away from its secret
TOM troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest
TOM itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had
TOM struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to ``whistle her down the
TOM wind,'' but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father's
TOM house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she
TOM should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an
TOM interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there
TOM was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;
TOM there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to
TOM try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who are
TOM infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of
TOM producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in
TOM these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a
TOM fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,
TOM but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the
TOM ``Health'' periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn
TOM ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the
TOM ``rot'' they contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how
TOM to get up, and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to
TOM take, and what frame of mind to keep one's self in, and what sort of
TOM clothing to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her
TOM health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they
TOM had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest
TOM as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered
TOM together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed
TOM with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with
TOM ``hell following after.'' But she never suspected that she was not an
TOM angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering
TOM neighbors.
TOM 
TOM The water treatment was new, now, and Tom's low condition was a windfall
TOM to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the
TOM wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed
TOM him down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she
TOM rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she
TOM sweated his soul clean and ``the yellow stains of it came through his
TOM pores'' -- as Tom said.
TOM 
TOM Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and
TOM pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and
TOM plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the
TOM water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his
TOM capacity as she would a jug's, and filled him up every day with quack
TOM cure-alls.
TOM 
TOM Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase
TOM filled the old lady's heart with consternation. This indifference must
TOM be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first
TOM time. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with
TOM gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water
TOM treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer. She
TOM gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the
TOM result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;
TOM for the ``indifference'' was broken up. The boy could not have shown a
TOM wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.
TOM 
TOM Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be
TOM romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have
TOM too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he
TOM thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit pon that of
TOM professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he
TOM became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and
TOM quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings
TOM to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle
TOM clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it
TOM did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in
TOM the sitting-room floor with it.
TOM 
TOM One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt's yellow
TOM cat came along, purring, eying the teaspoon avariciously, and begging
TOM for a taste. Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``Don't ask for it unless you want it, Peter.''
TOM 
TOM But Peter signified that he did want it.
TOM 
TOM ``You better make sure.''
TOM 
TOM Peter was sure.
TOM 
TOM ``Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there ain't
TOM anything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it, you mustn't
TOM blame anybody but your own self.''
TOM 
TOM Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down the
TOM Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then
TOM delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging
TOM against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next
TOM he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,
TOM with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his
TOM unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again
TOM spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time
TOM to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,
TOM and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots
TOM with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over
TOM her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, what on earth ails that cat?''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't know, aunt,'' gasped the boy.
TOM 
TOM ``Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?''
TOM 
TOM ``Deed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're having
TOM a good time.''
TOM 
TOM ``They do, do they?'' There was something in the tone that made Tom
TOM apprehensive.
TOM 
TOM ``Yes'm. That is, I believe they do.''
TOM 
TOM ``You DO?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes'm.''
TOM 
TOM The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized by
TOM anxiety. Too late he divined her ``drift.'' The handle of the telltale
TOM teaspoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it
TOM up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual
TOM handle -- his ear -- and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.
TOM 
TOM ``Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?''
TOM 
TOM ``I done it out of pity for him -- because he hadn't any aunt.''
TOM 
TOM ``Hadn't any aunt! -- you numskull. What has that got to do with it?''
TOM 
TOM ``Heaps. Because if he'd had one she'd a burnt him out herself! She'd a
TOM roasted his bowels out of him 'thout any more feeling than if he was a
TOM human!''
TOM 
TOM Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in
TOM a new light; what was cruelty to a cat MIGHT be cruelty to a boy, too.
TOM She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she
TOM put her hand on Tom's head and said gently:
TOM 
TOM ``I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it DID do you good.''
TOM 
TOM Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping
TOM through his gravity.
TOM 
TOM ``I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter.
TOM It done HIM good, too. I never see him get around so since --''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, go 'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try
TOM and see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you needn't take any
TOM more medicine.''
TOM 
TOM Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing
TOM had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late, he
TOM hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his
TOM comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to be
TOM looking everywhere but whither he really was looking -- down the road.
TOM Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom's face lighted; he gazed
TOM a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom
TOM accosted him; and ``led up'' warily to opportunities for remark about
TOM Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and
TOM watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the
TOM owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks
TOM ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered
TOM the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed
TOM in at the gate, and Tom's heart gave a great bound. The next instant he
TOM was out, and ``going on'' like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing
TOM boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing
TOM handsprings, standing on his head -- doing all the heroic things he
TOM could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see
TOM if Becky Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it
TOM all; she never looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that
TOM he was there? He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came
TOM war-whooping around, snatched a boy's cap, hurled it to the roof of the
TOM schoolhouse, broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every
TOM direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky's nose, almost
TOM upsetting her -- and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard
TOM her say: ``Mf! some people think they're mighty smart -- always showing
TOM off!''
TOM 
TOM Tom's cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and
TOM crestfallen.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XIII
TOM 
TOM TOM'S mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a
TOM forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out
TOM what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried
TOM to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing
TOM would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame HIM
TOM for the consequences -- why shouldn't they? What right had the
TOM friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would
TOM lead a life of crime. There was no choice.
TOM 
TOM By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to
TOM ``take up'' tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he
TOM should never, never hear that old familiar sound any more -- it was very
TOM hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold
TOM world, he must submit -- but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick
TOM and fast.
TOM 
TOM Just at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe Harper --
TOM hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart.
TOM Plainly here were ``two souls with but a single thought.'' Tom, wiping
TOM his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about a
TOM resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by
TOM roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping
TOM that Joe would not forget him.
TOM 
TOM But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going
TOM to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother
TOM had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and
TOM knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished
TOM him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but
TOM succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her
TOM poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.
TOM 
TOM As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand
TOM by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved
TOM them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for
TOM being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying, some
TOM time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he
TOM conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of
TOM crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.
TOM 
TOM Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River
TOM was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island,
TOM with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a
TOM rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further
TOM shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson's
TOM Island was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a
TOM matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,
TOM and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was
TOM indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the
TOM river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour -- which was
TOM midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.
TOM Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal
TOM in the most dark and mysterious way -- as became outlaws. And before the
TOM afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of
TOM spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would ``hear something.''
TOM All who got this vague hint were cautioned to ``be mum and wait.''
TOM 
TOM About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles, and
TOM stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
TOM meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay
TOM like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the
TOM quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under
TOM the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the
TOM same way. Then a guarded voice said:
TOM 
TOM ``Who goes there?''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.''
TOM 
TOM ``Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.'' Tom
TOM had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.
TOM 
TOM ``'Tis well. Give the countersign.''
TOM 
TOM Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the
TOM brooding night:
TOM 
TOM ``BLOOD!''
TOM 
TOM Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,
TOM tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was an
TOM easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked
TOM the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.
TOM 
TOM The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn
TOM himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a
TOM skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought
TOM a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or
TOM ``chewed'' but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it
TOM would never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;
TOM matches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering
TOM upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily
TOM thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing
TOM adventure of it, saying, ``Hist!'' every now and then, and suddenly
TOM halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts;
TOM and giving orders in dismal whispers that if ``the foe'' stirred, to
TOM ``let him have it to the hilt,'' because ``dead men tell no tales.''
TOM They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village
TOM laying in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for
TOM their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.
TOM 
TOM They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and
TOM Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded
TOM arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:
TOM 
TOM ``Luff, and bring her to the wind!''
TOM 
TOM ``Aye-aye, sir!''
TOM 
TOM ``Steady, steady-y-y-y!''
TOM 
TOM ``Steady it is, sir!''
TOM 
TOM ``Let her go off a point!''
TOM 
TOM ``Point it is, sir!''
TOM 
TOM As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream
TOM it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for
TOM ``style,'' and were not intended to mean anything in particular.
TOM 
TOM ``What sail's she carrying?''
TOM 
TOM ``Courses, tops'ls, and flying-jib, sir.''
TOM 
TOM ``Send the r'yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of ye --
TOM foretopmaststuns'l! Lively, now!''
TOM 
TOM ``Aye-aye, sir!''
TOM 
TOM ``Shake out that maintogalans'l! Sheets and braces! NOW my hearties!''
TOM 
TOM ``Aye-aye, sir!''
TOM 
TOM ``Hellum-a-lee -- hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes!
TOM Port, port! NOW, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!''
TOM 
TOM ``Steady it is, sir!''
TOM 
TOM The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head
TOM right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was
TOM not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during
TOM the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before the
TOM distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,
TOM peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,
TOM unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black
TOM Avenger stood still with folded arms, ``looking his last'' upon the
TOM scene of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing ``she''
TOM could see him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with
TOM dauntless heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was
TOM but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson's Island beyond
TOM eye-shot of the village, and so he ``looked his last'' with a broken and
TOM satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and
TOM they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift
TOM them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in
TOM time, and made shift to avert it. About two o'clock in the morning the
TOM raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,
TOM and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part
TOM of the little raft's belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they
TOM spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;
TOM but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as
TOM became outlaws.
TOM 
TOM They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps
TOM within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in
TOM the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn ``pone'' stock
TOM they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,
TOM free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,
TOM far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to
TOM civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy
TOM glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the
TOM varnished foliage and festooning vines.
TOM 
TOM When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance of
TOM corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,
TOM filled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but they
TOM would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting
TOM camp-fire.
TOM 
TOM ``AIN'T it gay?'' said Joe.
TOM 
TOM ``It's NUTS!'' said Tom. ``What would the boys say if they could see
TOM us?''
TOM 
TOM ``Say? Well, they'd just die to be here -- hey, Hucky!''
TOM 
TOM ``I reckon so,'' said Huckleberry; ``anyways, I'm suited. I don't want
TOM nothing better'n this. I don't ever get enough to eat, gen'ally -- and
TOM here they can't come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.''
TOM 
TOM ``It's just the life for me,'' said Tom. ``You don't have to get up,
TOM mornings, and you don't have to go to school, and wash, and all that
TOM blame foolishness. You see a pirate don't have to do ANYTHING, Joe, when
TOM he's ashore, but a hermit HE has to be praying considerable, and then he
TOM don't have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh yes, that's so,'' said Joe, ``but I hadn't thought much about it,
TOM you know. I'd a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I've tried it.''
TOM 
TOM ``You see,'' said Tom, ``people don't go much on hermits, nowadays, like
TOM they used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected. And a
TOM hermit's got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put
TOM sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and --''
TOM 
TOM ``What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?'' inquired Huck.
TOM 
TOM ``I dono. But they've GOT to do it. Hermits always do. You'd have to do
TOM that if you was a hermit.''
TOM 
TOM ``Dern'd if I would,'' said Huck.
TOM 
TOM ``Well, what would you do?''
TOM 
TOM ``I dono. But I wouldn't do that.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, Huck, you'd HAVE to. How'd you get around it?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, I just wouldn't stand it. I'd run away.''
TOM 
TOM ``Run away! Well, you WOULD be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You'd be a
TOM disgrace.''
TOM 
TOM The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished
TOM gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with
TOM tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of
TOM fragrant smoke -- he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The
TOM other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to
TOM acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:
TOM 
TOM ``What does pirates have to do?''
TOM 
TOM Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, they have just a bully time -- take ships and burn them, and get
TOM the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there's
TOM ghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships -- make
TOM 'em walk a plank.''
TOM 
TOM ``And they carry the women to the island,'' said Joe; ``they don't kill
TOM the women.''
TOM 
TOM ``No,'' assented Tom, ``they don't kill the women -- they're too noble.
TOM And the women's always beautiful, too.''
TOM 
TOM ``And don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver
TOM and di'monds,'' said Joe, with enthusiasm.
TOM 
TOM ``Who?'' said Huck.
TOM 
TOM ``Why, the pirates.''
TOM 
TOM Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.
TOM 
TOM ``I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate,'' said he, with a
TOM regretful pathos in his voice; ``but I ain't got none but these.''
TOM 
TOM But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,
TOM after they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand
TOM that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for
TOM wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.
TOM 
TOM Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the
TOM eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the
TOM Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.
TOM The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had
TOM more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,
TOM and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them
TOM kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at
TOM all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they
TOM might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at
TOM once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep -- but an
TOM intruder came, now, that would not ``down.'' It was conscience. They
TOM began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away;
TOM and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture
TOM came. They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had
TOM purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not
TOM to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the
TOM end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking
TOM sweetmeats was only ``hooking,'' while taking bacon and hams and such
TOM valuables was plain simple stealing -- and there was a command against
TOM that in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they
TOM remained in the business, their piracies should not again be sullied
TOM with the crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these
TOM curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.

TOM Chapter XIV
TOM 
TOM WHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and
TOM rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool
TOM gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the
TOM deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not a
TOM sound obtruded upon great Nature's meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood
TOM upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,
TOM and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck
TOM still slept.
TOM 
TOM Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently
TOM the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray of
TOM the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life
TOM manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to
TOM work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came
TOM crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air
TOM from time to time and ``sniffing around,'' then proceeding again -- for
TOM he was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own
TOM accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,
TOM by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go
TOM elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its
TOM curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg and
TOM began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad -- for that meant
TOM that he was going to have a new suit of clothes -- without the shadow of
TOM a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,
TOM from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled
TOM manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,
TOM and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed
TOM the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and
TOM said, ``Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your
TOM children's alone,'' and she took wing and went off to see about it --
TOM which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was
TOM credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity
TOM more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and
TOM Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body and
TOM pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A
TOM catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom's head, and trilled
TOM out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a
TOM shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig
TOM almost within the boy's reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the
TOM strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow
TOM of the ``fox'' kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to
TOM inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never
TOM seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.
TOM All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight
TOM pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few
TOM butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.
TOM 
TOM Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a
TOM shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and
TOM tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white
TOM sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the
TOM distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a
TOM slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only
TOM gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge
TOM between them and civilization.
TOM 
TOM They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and
TOM ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a
TOM spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak
TOM or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood
TOM charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe
TOM was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a
TOM minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in
TOM their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time to
TOM get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass, a
TOM couple of sun-perch and a small catfish -- provisions enough for quite a
TOM family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for no
TOM fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the
TOM quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better
TOM he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,
TOM open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.
TOM 
TOM They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,
TOM and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They
TOM tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,
TOM among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the
TOM ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came
TOM upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.
TOM 
TOM They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be
TOM astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles
TOM long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to
TOM was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards
TOM wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle
TOM of the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to
TOM stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw
TOM themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag,
TOM and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods,
TOM and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.
TOM They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This
TOM took dim shape, presently -- it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the
TOM Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they
TOM were all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak
TOM his thought.
TOM 
TOM For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar
TOM sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a
TOM clock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound
TOM became more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,
TOM glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There
TOM was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came
TOM floating down out of the distance.
TOM 
TOM ``What is it!'' exclaimed Joe, under his breath.
TOM 
TOM ``I wonder,'' said Tom in a whisper.
TOM 
TOM ``'Tain't thunder,'' said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, ``becuz thunder
TOM --''
TOM 
TOM ``Hark!'' said Tom. ``Listen -- don't talk.''
TOM 
TOM They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom
TOM troubled the solemn hush.
TOM 
TOM ``Let's go and see.''
TOM 
TOM They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They
TOM parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little
TOM steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the
TOM current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great
TOM many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood
TOM of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in them
TOM were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the
TOM ferryboat's side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same
TOM dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.
TOM 
TOM ``I know now!'' exclaimed Tom; ``somebody's drownded!''
TOM 
TOM ``That's it!'' said Huck; ``they done that last summer, when Bill Turner
TOM got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes him
TOM come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put
TOM quicksilver in 'em and set 'em afloat, and wherever there's anybody
TOM that's drownded, they'll float right there and stop.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, I've heard about that,'' said Joe. ``I wonder what makes the
TOM bread do that.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, it ain't the bread, so much,'' said Tom; ``I reckon it's mostly
TOM what they SAY over it before they start it out.''
TOM 
TOM ``But they don't say anything over it,'' said Huck. ``I've seen 'em and
TOM they don't.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, that's funny,'' said Tom. ``But maybe they say it to themselves.
TOM Of COURSE they do. Anybody might know that.''
TOM 
TOM The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because an
TOM ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not be
TOM expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such
TOM gravity.
TOM 
TOM ``By jings, I wish I was over there, now,'' said Joe.
TOM 
TOM ``I do too'' said Huck ``I'd give heaps to know who it is.''
TOM 
TOM The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought
TOM flashed through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:
TOM 
TOM ``Boys, I know who's drownded -- it's us!''
TOM 
TOM They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they
TOM were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;
TOM tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor
TOM lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being
TOM indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town,
TOM and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was
TOM concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.
TOM 
TOM As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business
TOM and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were
TOM jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble
TOM they were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then
TOM fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them;
TOM and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were
TOM gratifying to look upon -- from their point of view. But when the
TOM shadows of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat
TOM gazing into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere.
TOM The excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back
TOM thoughts of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine
TOM frolic as much as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and
TOM unhappy; a sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured
TOM upon a roundabout ``feeler'' as to how the others might look upon a
TOM return to civilization -- not right now, but --
TOM 
TOM Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined
TOM in with Tom, and the waverer quickly ``explained,'' and was glad to get
TOM out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness
TOM clinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to
TOM rest for the moment.
TOM 
TOM As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore. Joe
TOM followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,
TOM watching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,
TOM and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung
TOM by the camp-fire. He picked up and inspected several large
TOM semi-cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose
TOM two which seemed to suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully
TOM wrote something upon each of these with his ``red keel''; one he rolled
TOM up and put in his jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe's hat and
TOM removed it to a little distance from the owner. And he also put into the
TOM hat certain schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value -- among
TOM them a lump of chalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of
TOM that kind of marbles known as a ``sure 'nough crystal.'' Then he tiptoed
TOM his way cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of
TOM hearing, and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the
TOM sandbar.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XV
TOM 
TOM A FEW minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward
TOM the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was half-way
TOM over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out
TOM confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering
TOM upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had
TOM expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till
TOM he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket
TOM pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,
TOM following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten o'clock
TOM he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the
TOM ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything
TOM was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching
TOM with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes
TOM and climbed into the skiff that did ``yawl'' duty at the boat's stern.
TOM He laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.
TOM 
TOM Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to ``cast
TOM off.'' A minute or two later the skiff's head was standing high up,
TOM against the boat's swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in
TOM his success, for he knew it was the boat's last trip for the night. At
TOM the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and Tom
TOM slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards
TOM downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.
TOM 
TOM He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his
TOM aunt's back fence. He climbed over, approached the ``ell,'' and looked
TOM in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There sat
TOM Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper's mother, grouped together,
TOM talking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the
TOM door. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then he
TOM pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing
TOM cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might
TOM squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,
TOM warily.
TOM 
TOM ``What makes the candle blow so?'' said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up.
TOM ``Why, that door's open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of
TOM strange things now. Go 'long and shut it, Sid.''
TOM 
TOM Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and ``breathed''
TOM himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his
TOM aunt's foot.
TOM 
TOM ``But as I was saying,'' said Aunt Polly, ``he warn't BAD, so to say --
TOM only mischEEvous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn't
TOM any more responsible than a colt. HE never meant any harm, and he was
TOM the best-hearted boy that ever was'' -- and she began to cry.
TOM 
TOM ``It was just so with my Joe -- always full of his devilment, and up to
TOM every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he
TOM could be -- and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for
TOM taking that cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself
TOM because it was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never,
TOM never, never, poor abused boy!'' And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart
TOM would break.
TOM 
TOM ``I hope Tom's better off where he is,'' said Sid, ``but if he'd been
TOM better in some ways --''
TOM 
TOM ``SID!'' Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eye, though he could not
TOM see it. ``Not a word against my Tom, now that he's gone! God'll take
TOM care of HIM -- never you trouble YOURself, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don't
TOM know how to give him up! I don't know how to give him up! He was such a
TOM comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, 'most.''
TOM 
TOM ``The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away -- Blessed be the name of
TOM the Lord! But it's so hard -- Oh, it's so hard! Only last Saturday my
TOM Joe busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him
TOM sprawling. Little did I know then, how soon -- Oh, if it was to do over
TOM again I'd hug him and bless him for it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just
TOM exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took and
TOM filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would
TOM tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom's head with my
TOM thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he's out of all his troubles now.
TOM And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach --''
TOM 
TOM But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely
TOM down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself -- and more in pity of himself
TOM than anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly
TOM word for him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of
TOM himself than ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his
TOM aunt's grief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her
TOM with joy -- and the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed
TOM strongly to his nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.
TOM 
TOM He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was
TOM conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;
TOM then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing
TOM lads had promised that the village should ``hear something'' soon; the
TOM wise-heads had ``put this and that together'' and decided that the lads
TOM had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,
TOM presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the
TOM Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village -- and then hope
TOM perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home
TOM by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the
TOM bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have
TOM occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would
TOM otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies
TOM continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the
TOM funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.
TOM 
TOM Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing good-night and turned to go. Then with a
TOM mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other's
TOM arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was
TOM tender far beyond her wont, in her good-night to Sid and Mary. Sid
TOM snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.
TOM 
TOM Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,
TOM and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,
TOM that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.
TOM 
TOM He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making
TOM broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and
TOM turning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her
TOM sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the
TOM candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full
TOM of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the
TOM candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering. His
TOM face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark
TOM hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and
TOM straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.
TOM 
TOM He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large
TOM there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was
TOM tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and
TOM slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped
TOM into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a
TOM mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself
TOM stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for
TOM this was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture the
TOM skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore
TOM legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be
TOM made for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and
TOM entered the woods.
TOM 
TOM He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep
TOM awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far
TOM spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the
TOM island bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the
TOM great river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A
TOM little later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and
TOM heard Joe say:
TOM 
TOM ``No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't desert. He
TOM knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's too proud for that
TOM sort of thing. He's up to something or other. Now I wonder what?''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?''
TOM 
TOM ``Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain't
TOM back here to breakfast.''
TOM 
TOM ``Which he is!'' exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping
TOM grandly into camp.
TOM 
TOM A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the
TOM boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.
TOM They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.
TOM Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the
TOM other pirates got ready to fish and explore.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XVI
TOM 
TOM AFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.
TOM They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft
TOM place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes
TOM they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly
TOM round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a
TOM famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.
TOM 
TOM After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and
TOM chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until
TOM they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal
TOM water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their
TOM legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.
TOM And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each
TOM other's faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with
TOM averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and
TOM struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went
TOM under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,
TOM sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.
TOM 
TOM When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,
TOM hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by
TOM break for the water again and go through the original performance once
TOM more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented
TOM flesh-colored ``tights'' very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand
TOM and had a circus -- with three clowns in it, for none would yield this
TOM proudest post to his neighbor.
TOM 
TOM Next they got their marbles and played ``knucks'' and ``ring-taw'' and
TOM ``keeps'' till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another
TOM swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off
TOM his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his
TOM ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the
TOM protection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he
TOM had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to
TOM rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the ``dumps,'' and
TOM fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay
TOM drowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing ``BECKY'' in the sand
TOM with his big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for
TOM his weakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it.
TOM He erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by
TOM driving the other boys together and joining them.
TOM 
TOM But Joe's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so
TOM homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay
TOM very near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was down-hearted,
TOM but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready to
TOM tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he
TOM would have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:
TOM 
TOM ``I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll explore
TOM it again. They've hid treasures here somewhere. How'd you feel to light
TOM on a rotten chest full of gold and silver -- hey?''
TOM 
TOM But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply. Tom
TOM tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was
TOM discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking
TOM very gloomy. Finally he said:
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so lonesome.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by,'' said Tom. ``Just think of
TOM the fishing that's here.''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't care for fishing. I want to go home.''
TOM 
TOM ``But, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place anywhere.''
TOM 
TOM ``Swimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow, when there
TOM ain't anybody to say I sha'n't go in. I mean to go home.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, I DO want to see my mother -- and you would, too, if you had one.
TOM I ain't any more baby than you are.'' And Joe snuffled a little.
TOM 
TOM ``Well, we'll let the cry-baby go home to his mother, won't we, Huck?
TOM Poor thing -- does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like
TOM it here, don't you, Huck? We'll stay, won't we?''
TOM 
TOM Huck said, ``Y-e-s'' -- without any heart in it.
TOM 
TOM ``I'll never speak to you again as long as I live,'' said Joe, rising.
TOM ``There now!'' And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.
TOM 
TOM ``Who cares!'' said Tom. ``Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and get
TOM laughed at. Oh, you're a nice pirate. Huck and me ain't cry-babies.
TOM We'll stay, won't we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can
TOM get along without him, per'aps.''
TOM 
TOM But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly
TOM on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying
TOM Joe's preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.
TOM Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the
TOM Illinois shore. Tom's heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck
TOM could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:
TOM 
TOM ``I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now
TOM it'll be worse. Let's us go, too, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``I won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, I better go.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, go 'long -- who's hendering you.''
TOM 
TOM Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, I wisht you'd come, too. Now you think it over. We'll wait for
TOM you when we get to shore.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, you'll wait a blame long time, that's all.''
TOM 
TOM Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a
TOM strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too.
TOM He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It
TOM suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made
TOM one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades,
TOM yelling:
TOM 
TOM ``Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!''
TOM 
TOM They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they
TOM were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till at
TOM last they saw the ``point'' he was driving at, and then they set up a
TOM war-whoop of applause and said it was ``splendid!'' and said if he had
TOM told them at first, they wouldn't have started away. He made a plausible
TOM excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret
TOM would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had
TOM meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.
TOM 
TOM The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,
TOM chattering all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and admiring the
TOM genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to
TOM learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to
TOM try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never
TOM smoked anything before but cigars made of grape-vine, and they ``bit''
TOM the tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.
TOM 
TOM Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,
TOM charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,
TOM and they gagged a little, but Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``Why, it's just as easy! If I'd a knowed this was all, I'd a learnt
TOM long ago.''
TOM 
TOM ``So would I,'' said Joe. ``It's just nothing.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought well I
TOM wish I could do that; but I never thought I could,'' said Tom.
TOM 
TOM ``That's just the way with me, hain't it, Huck? You've heard me talk
TOM just that way -- haven't you, Huck? I'll leave it to Huck if I
TOM haven't.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes -- heaps of times,'' said Huck.
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I have too,'' said Tom; ``oh, hundreds of times. Once down by
TOM the slaughter-house. Don't you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and
TOM Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don't you remember,
TOM Huck, 'bout me saying that?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, that's so,'' said Huck. ``That was the day after I lost a white
TOM alley. No, 'twas the day before.''
TOM 
TOM ``There -- I told you so,'' said Tom. ``Huck recollects it.''
TOM 
TOM ``I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,'' said Joe. ``I don't feel
TOM sick.''
TOM 
TOM ``Neither do I,'' said Tom. ``I could smoke it all day. But I bet you
TOM Jeff Thatcher couldn't.''
TOM 
TOM ``Jeff Thatcher! Why, he'd keel over just with two draws. Just let him
TOM try it once. HE'D see!''
TOM 
TOM ``I bet he would. And Johnny Miller -- I wish could see Johnny Miller
TOM tackle it once.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, don't I!'' said Joe. ``Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't any
TOM more do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch HIM.''
TOM 
TOM ``'Deed it would, Joe. Say -- I wish the boys could see us now.''
TOM 
TOM ``So do I.''
TOM 
TOM ``Say -- boys, don't say anything about it, and some time when they're
TOM around, I'll come up to you and say, 'Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.'
TOM And you'll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn't anything, you'll
TOM say, 'Yes, I got my OLD pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain't
TOM very good.' And I'll say, 'Oh, that's all right, if it's STRONG enough.'
TOM And then you'll out with the pipes, and we'll light up just as ca'm, and
TOM then just see 'em look!''
TOM 
TOM ``By jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was NOW!''
TOM 
TOM ``So do I! And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off pirating,
TOM won't they wish they'd been along?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, I reckon not! I'll just BET they will!''
TOM 
TOM So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and grow
TOM disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously
TOM increased. Every pore inside the boys' cheeks became a spouting
TOM fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues
TOM fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their
TOM throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings
TOM followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,
TOM now. Joe's pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom's followed. Both
TOM fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and
TOM main. Joe said feebly:
TOM 
TOM ``I've lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.''
TOM 
TOM Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:
TOM 
TOM ``I'll help you. You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the
TOM spring. No, you needn't come, Huck -- we can find it.''
TOM 
TOM So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,
TOM and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both
TOM very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had
TOM had any trouble they had got rid of it.
TOM 
TOM They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,
TOM and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare
TOM theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well -- something they
TOM ate at dinner had disagreed with them.
TOM 
TOM About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding
TOM oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys
TOM huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of the
TOM fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was
TOM stifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.
TOM Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the
TOM blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that
TOM vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by
TOM another came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came
TOM sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting
TOM breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit
TOM of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned
TOM night into day and showed every little grass-blade, separate and
TOM distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,
TOM startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling
TOM down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A
TOM sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the
TOM flaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the
TOM forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the tree-tops
TOM right over the boys' heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick
TOM gloom that followed. A few big rain-drops fell pattering upon the
TOM leaves.
TOM 
TOM ``Quick! boys, go for the tent!'' exclaimed Tom.
TOM 
TOM They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no
TOM two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through the
TOM trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after
TOM another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching
TOM rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the
TOM ground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the
TOM booming thunder-blasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one
TOM they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,
TOM and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something
TOM to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so
TOM furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest
TOM rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its
TOM fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each
TOM others' hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter
TOM of a great oak that stood upon the river-bank. Now the battle was at its
TOM highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in
TOM the skies, everything below stood out in clean-cut and shadowless
TOM distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the
TOM driving spray of spume-flakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on
TOM the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloud-rack and the
TOM slanting veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the
TOM fight and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging
TOM thunder-peals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and
TOM sharp, and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless
TOM effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up,
TOM drown it to the tree-tops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in
TOM it, all at one and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless
TOM young heads to be out in.
TOM 
TOM But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and
TOM weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The boys
TOM went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still
TOM something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter of
TOM their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were
TOM not under it when the catastrophe happened.
TOM 
TOM Everything in camp was drenched, the camp-fire as well; for they were
TOM but heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision
TOM against rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through
TOM and chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently
TOM discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had
TOM been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from the
TOM ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they
TOM patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under
TOM sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they
TOM piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were
TOM glad-hearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and
TOM after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their
TOM midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep
TOM on, anywhere around.
TOM 
TOM As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over them,
TOM and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got
TOM scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After
TOM the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little home-sick once
TOM more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as
TOM he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or
TOM anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of
TOM cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was
TOM to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.
TOM They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were
TOM stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many
TOM zebras -- all of them chiefs, of course -- and then they went tearing
TOM through the woods to attack an English settlement.
TOM 
TOM By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each
TOM other from ambush with dreadful war-whoops, and killed and scalped each
TOM other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely
TOM satisfactory one.
TOM 
TOM They assembled in camp toward supper-time, hungry and happy; but now a
TOM difficulty arose -- hostile Indians could not break the bread of
TOM hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple
TOM impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other
TOM process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished
TOM they had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such
TOM show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and
TOM took their whiff as it passed, in due form.
TOM 
TOM And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had
TOM gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without
TOM having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to
TOM be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high
TOM promise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper,
TOM with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were
TOM prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been
TOM in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to
TOM smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at
TOM present.

TOM Chapter XVII
TOM 
TOM BUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday
TOM afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly's family, were being put into
TOM mourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet possessed
TOM the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience.
TOM The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked
TOM little; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to
TOM the children. They had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them
TOM up.
TOM 
TOM In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted
TOM schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing
TOM there to comfort her. She soliloquized:
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't got
TOM anything now to remember him by.'' And she choked back a little sob.
TOM 
TOM Presently she stopped, and said to herself:
TOM 
TOM ``It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn't say that
TOM -- I wouldn't say it for the whole world. But he's gone now; I'll never,
TOM never, never see him any more.''
TOM 
TOM This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling
TOM down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls -- playmates of
TOM Tom's and Joe's -- came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and
TOM talking in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they
TOM saw him, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with
TOM awful prophecy, as they could easily see now!) -- and each speaker
TOM pointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and
TOM then added something like ``and I was a-standing just so -- just as I am
TOM now, and as if you was him -- I was as close as that -- and he smiled,
TOM just this way -- and then something seemed to go all over me, like --
TOM awful, you know -- and I never thought what it meant, of course, but I
TOM can see now!''
TOM 
TOM Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and
TOM many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or
TOM less tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided
TOM who DID see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,
TOM the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance, and
TOM were gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had no
TOM other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the
TOM remembrance:
TOM 
TOM ``Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.''
TOM 
TOM But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that,
TOM and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away,
TOM still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.
TOM 
TOM When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell
TOM began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still
TOM Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush
TOM that lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment
TOM in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there
TOM was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses as
TOM the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None
TOM could remember when the little church had been so full before. There was
TOM finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly
TOM entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in
TOM deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose
TOM reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.
TOM There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled
TOM sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving
TOM hymn was sung, and the text followed: ``I am the Resurrection and the
TOM Life.''
TOM 
TOM As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the
TOM graces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that
TOM every soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang in
TOM remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always
TOM before, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor
TOM boys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the
TOM departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the
TOM people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes
TOM were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had
TOM seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation
TOM became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last
TOM the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus
TOM of anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and
TOM crying in the pulpit.
TOM 
TOM There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later
TOM the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above
TOM his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair
TOM of eyes followed the minister's, and then almost with one impulse the
TOM congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up
TOM the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags,
TOM sneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery
TOM listening to their own funeral sermon!
TOM 
TOM Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored
TOM ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while
TOM poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what to
TOM do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and
TOM started to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Aunt Polly, it ain't fair. Somebody's got to be glad to see Huck.''
TOM 
TOM ``And so they shall. I'm glad to see him, poor motherless thing!'' And
TOM the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing
TOM capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.
TOM 
TOM Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: ``Praise God from
TOM whom all blessings flow -- SING! -- and put your hearts in it!''
TOM 
TOM And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and while
TOM it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the
TOM envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the
TOM proudest moment of his life.
TOM 
TOM As the ``sold'' congregation trooped out they said they would almost be
TOM willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that
TOM once more.
TOM 
TOM Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day -- according to Aunt Polly's
TOM varying moods -- than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew
TOM which expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XVIII
TOM 
TOM THAT was Tom's great secret -- the scheme to return home with his
TOM brother pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to
TOM the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six
TOM miles below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the
TOM town till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and
TOM alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a
TOM chaos of invalided benches.
TOM 
TOM At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to
TOM Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of
TOM talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody
TOM suffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you
TOM could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over
TOM on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a
TOM hint some way that you warn't dead, but only run off.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, you could have done that, Tom,'' said Mary; ``and I believe you
TOM would if you had thought of it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Would you, Tom?'' said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. ``Say,
TOM now, would you, if you'd thought of it?''
TOM 
TOM ``I -- well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled everything.''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,'' said Aunt Polly, with a grieved
TOM tone that discomforted the boy. ``It would have been something if you'd
TOM cared enough to THINK of it, even if you didn't DO it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Now, auntie, that ain't any harm,'' pleaded Mary; ``it's only Tom's
TOM giddy way -- he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of
TOM anything.''
TOM 
TOM ``More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and
TOM DONE it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's too late, and
TOM wish you'd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so
TOM little.''
TOM 
TOM ``Now, auntie, you know I do care for you,'' said Tom.
TOM 
TOM ``I'd know it better if you acted more like it.''
TOM 
TOM ``I wish now I'd thought,'' said Tom, with a repentant tone; ``but I
TOM dreamt about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?''
TOM 
TOM ``It ain't much -- a cat does that much -- but it's better than nothing.
TOM What did you dream?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the
TOM bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could take even
TOM that much trouble about us.''
TOM 
TOM ``And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, lots. But it's so dim, now.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, try to recollect -- can't you?''
TOM 
TOM ``Somehow it seems to me that the wind -- the wind blowed the -- the
TOM --''
TOM 
TOM ``Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!''
TOM 
TOM Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then
TOM said:
TOM 
TOM ``I've got it now! I've got it now! It blowed the candle!''
TOM 
TOM ``Mercy on us! Go on, Tom -- go on!''
TOM 
TOM ``And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that door --'''
TOM 
TOM ``Go ON, Tom!''
TOM 
TOM ``Just let me study a moment -- just a moment. Oh, yes -- you said you
TOM believed the door was open.''
TOM 
TOM ``As I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!''
TOM 
TOM ``And then -- and then -- well I won't be certain, but it seems like as
TOM if you made Sid go and -- and --''
TOM 
TOM ``Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?''
TOM 
TOM ``You made him -- you -- Oh, you made him shut it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my
TOM days! Don't tell ME there ain't anything in dreams, any more. Sereny
TOM Harper shall know of this before I'm an hour older. I'd like to see her
TOM get around THIS with her rubbage 'bout superstition. Go on, Tom!''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I
TOM warn't BAD, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more
TOM responsible than -- than -- I think it was a colt, or something.''
TOM 
TOM ``And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!''
TOM 
TOM ``And then you began to cry.''
TOM 
TOM ``So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then --''
TOM 
TOM ``Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and
TOM she wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when she'd throwed it
TOM out her own self --''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying -- that's what
TOM you was doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!''
TOM 
TOM ``Then Sid he said -- he said --''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't think I said anything,'' said Sid.
TOM 
TOM ``Yes you did, Sid,'' said Mary.
TOM 
TOM ``Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM ``He said -- I THINK he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone
TOM to, but if I'd been better sometimes --''
TOM 
TOM ``THERE, d'you hear that! It was his very words!''
TOM 
TOM ``And you shut him up sharp.''
TOM 
TOM ``I lay I did! There must 'a' been an angel there. There WAS an angel
TOM there, somewheres!''
TOM 
TOM ``And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you
TOM told about Peter and the Painkiller --''
TOM 
TOM ``Just as true as I live!''
TOM 
TOM ``And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for
TOM us, and 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss
TOM Harper hugged and cried, and she went.''
TOM 
TOM ``It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm a-sitting in
TOM these very tracks. Tom, you couldn't told it more like if you'd 'a' seen
TOM it! And then what? Go on, Tom!''
TOM 
TOM ``Then I thought you prayed for me -- and I could see you and hear every
TOM word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and
TOM wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't dead -- we are only off
TOM being pirates,' and put it on the table by the candle; and then you
TOM looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned
TOM over and kissed you on the lips.''
TOM 
TOM ``Did you, Tom, DID you! I just forgive you everything for that!'' And
TOM she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the
TOM guiltiest of villains.
TOM 
TOM ``It was very kind, even though it was only a -- dream,'' Sid
TOM soliloquized just audibly.
TOM 
TOM ``Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do if he
TOM was awake. Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you, Tom, if
TOM you was ever found again -- now go 'long to school. I'm thankful to the
TOM good God and Father of us all I've got you back, that's long-suffering
TOM and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though
TOM goodness knows I'm unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His
TOM blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there's
TOM few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long
TOM night comes. Go 'long Sid, Mary, Tom -- take yourselves off -- you've
TOM hendered me long enough.''
TOM 
TOM The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper
TOM and vanquish her realism with Tom's marvellous dream. Sid had better
TOM judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the
TOM house. It was this: ``Pretty thin -- as long a dream as that, without
TOM any mistakes in it!''
TOM 
TOM What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,
TOM but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the
TOM public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see
TOM the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and
TOM drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud
TOM to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer
TOM at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into
TOM town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at
TOM all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have
TOM given anything to have that swarthy suntanned skin of his, and his
TOM glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a
TOM circus.
TOM 
TOM At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered
TOM such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were not
TOM long in becoming insufferably ``stuck-up.'' They began to tell their
TOM adventures to hungry listeners -- but they only began; it was not a
TOM thing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish
TOM material. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely
TOM puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.
TOM 
TOM Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory
TOM was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,
TOM maybe she would be wanting to ``make up.'' Well, let her -- she should
TOM see that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she
TOM arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group
TOM of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was
TOM tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,
TOM pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter
TOM when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her
TOM captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in
TOM his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity
TOM that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only ``set him up''
TOM the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew
TOM she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved
TOM irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and
TOM wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more
TOM particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang
TOM and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her
TOM feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to
TOM a girl almost at Tom's elbow -- with sham vivacity:
TOM 
TOM ``Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to
TOM Sunday-school?''
TOM 
TOM ``I did come -- didn't you see me?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?''
TOM 
TOM ``I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go. I saw YOU.''
TOM 
TOM ``Did you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about
TOM the picnic.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?''
TOM 
TOM ``My ma's going to let me have one.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, goody; I hope she'll let ME come.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, she will. The picnic's for me. She'll let anybody come that I
TOM want, and I want you.''
TOM 
TOM ``That's ever so nice. When is it going to be?''
TOM 
TOM ``By and by. Maybe about vacation.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, every one that's friends to me -- or wants to be''; and she
TOM glanced ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy
TOM Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning
TOM tore the great sycamore tree ``all to flinders'' while he was ``standing
TOM within three feet of it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, may I come?'' said Grace Miller.
TOM 
TOM ``Yes.''
TOM 
TOM ``And me?'' said Sally Rogers.
TOM 
TOM ``Yes.''
TOM 
TOM ``And me, too?'' said Susy Harper. ``And Joe?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes.''
TOM 
TOM And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged
TOM for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still
TOM talking, and took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled and the tears came
TOM to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on
TOM chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of
TOM everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and
TOM had what her sex call ``a good cry.'' Then she sat moody, with wounded
TOM pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast in
TOM her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what SHE'D
TOM do.
TOM 
TOM At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant
TOM self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate
TOM her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden
TOM falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind
TOM the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple -- and so
TOM absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,
TOM that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.
TOM Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom's veins. He began to hate himself for
TOM throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He
TOM called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He
TOM wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,
TOM for her heart was singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function. He
TOM did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he
TOM could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as
TOM otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the school-house, again and
TOM again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could
TOM not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that
TOM Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the
TOM living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her
TOM fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.
TOM 
TOM Amy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had to
TOM attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in vain
TOM -- the girl chirped on. Tom thought, ``Oh, hang her, ain't I ever going
TOM to get rid of her?'' At last he must be attending to those things -- and
TOM she said artlessly that she would be ``around'' when school let out. And
TOM he hastened away, hating her for it.
TOM 
TOM ``Any other boy!'' Tom thought, grating his teeth. ``Any boy in the
TOM whole town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine
TOM and is aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever
TOM saw this town, mister, and I'll lick you again! You just wait till I
TOM catch you out! I'll just take and --''
TOM 
TOM And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy --
TOM pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging. ``Oh, you do, do you? You
TOM holler 'nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!'' And so the
TOM imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.
TOM 
TOM Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy's
TOM grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other
TOM distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the
TOM minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to
TOM cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absent-mindedness followed, and
TOM then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at a
TOM footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew
TOM entirely miserable and wished she hadn't carried it so far. When poor
TOM Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept
TOM exclaiming: ``Oh, here's a jolly one! look at this!'' she lost patience
TOM at last, and said, ``Oh, don't bother me! I don't care for them!'' and
TOM burst into tears, and got up and walked away.
TOM 
TOM Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she
TOM said:
TOM 
TOM ``Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!''
TOM 
TOM So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done -- for she had said
TOM she would look at pictures all through the nooning -- and she walked on,
TOM crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted school-house. He was
TOM humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth -- the girl
TOM had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.
TOM He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.
TOM He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much
TOM risk to himself. Tom's spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his
TOM opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and
TOM poured ink upon the page.
TOM 
TOM Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,
TOM and moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,
TOM intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their
TOM troubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she had
TOM changed her mind. The thought of Tom's treatment of her when she was
TOM talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame.
TOM She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book's
TOM account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XIX
TOM 
TOM TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said
TOM to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising
TOM market:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!''
TOM 
TOM ``Auntie, what have I done?''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old
TOM softy, expecting I'm going to make her believe all that rubbage about
TOM that dream, when lo and behold you she'd found out from Joe that you was
TOM over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don't know
TOM what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so
TOM bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool
TOM of myself and never say a word.''
TOM 
TOM This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had
TOM seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked
TOM mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to
TOM say for a moment. Then he said:
TOM 
TOM ``Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it -- but I didn't think.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own
TOM selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from
TOM Jackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could
TOM think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn't ever think
TOM to pity us and save us from sorrow.''
TOM 
TOM ``Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I
TOM didn't, honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at you
TOM that night.''
TOM 
TOM ``What did you come for, then?''
TOM 
TOM ``It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't got
TOM drownded.''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could
TOM believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never
TOM did -- and I know it, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie -- I wish I may never stir if I
TOM didn't.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Tom, don't lie -- don't do it. It only makes things a hundred
TOM times worse.''
TOM 
TOM ``It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you from
TOM grieving -- that was all that made me come.''
TOM 
TOM ``I'd give the whole world to believe that -- it would cover up a power
TOM of sins, Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so bad. But it
TOM ain't reasonable; because, why didn't you tell me, child?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got
TOM all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I
TOM couldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my
TOM pocket and kept mum.''
TOM 
TOM ``What bark?''
TOM 
TOM ``The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I wish, now,
TOM you'd waked up when I kissed you -- I do, honest.''
TOM 
TOM The hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned
TOM in her eyes.
TOM 
TOM ``DID you kiss me, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, yes, I did.''
TOM 
TOM ``Are you sure you did, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, yes, I did, auntie -- certain sure.''
TOM 
TOM ``What did you kiss me for, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM ``Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so
TOM sorry.''
TOM 
TOM The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in
TOM her voice when she said:
TOM 
TOM ``Kiss me again, Tom! -- and be off with you to school, now, and don't
TOM bother me any more.''
TOM 
TOM The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a
TOM jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her
TOM hand, and said to herself:
TOM 
TOM ``No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about it -- but it's a
TOM blessed, blessed lie, there's such a comfort come from it. I hope the
TOM Lord -- I KNOW the Lord will forgive him, because it was such
TOM good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don't want to find out it's a
TOM lie. I won't look.''
TOM 
TOM She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out
TOM her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more
TOM she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought:
TOM ``It's a good lie -- it's a good lie -- I won't let it grieve me.'' So
TOM she sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom's piece
TOM of bark through flowing tears and saying: ``I could forgive the boy,
TOM now, if he'd committed a million sins!''
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XX
TOM 
TOM THERE was something about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed Tom, that
TOM swept away his low spirits and made him light-hearted and happy again.
TOM He started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at
TOM the head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without
TOM a moment's hesitation he ran to her and said:
TOM 
TOM ``I acted mighty mean to-day, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't ever,
TOM ever do that way again, as long as ever I live -- please make up, won't
TOM you?''
TOM 
TOM The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:
TOM 
TOM ``I'll thank you to keep yourself TO yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I'll
TOM never speak to you again.''
TOM 
TOM She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not
TOM even presence of mind enough to say ``Who cares, Miss Smarty?'' until
TOM the right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in
TOM a fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were
TOM a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently
TOM encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled
TOM one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in
TOM her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to ``take
TOM in,'' she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured
TOM spelling-book. If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred
TOM Temple, Tom's offensive fling had driven it entirely away.
TOM 
TOM Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.
TOM The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied
TOM ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but poverty
TOM had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village
TOM schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and
TOM absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept
TOM that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was
TOM perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy
TOM and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories
TOM were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.
TOM Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she
TOM noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She
TOM glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the
TOM book in her hands. The title-page -- Professor Somebody's ANATOMY --
TOM carried no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She
TOM came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece -- a
TOM human figure, stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and
TOM Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture.
TOM Becky snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear
TOM the pictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the
TOM desk, turned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.
TOM 
TOM ``Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a
TOM person and look at what they're looking at.''
TOM 
TOM ``How could I know you was looking at anything?''
TOM 
TOM ``You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're going
TOM to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be
TOM whipped, and I never was whipped in school.''
TOM 
TOM Then she stamped her little foot and said:
TOM 
TOM ``BE so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to happen.
TOM You just wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!'' -- and she
TOM flung out of the house with a new explosion of crying.
TOM 
TOM Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said
TOM to himself:
TOM 
TOM ``What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in school!
TOM Shucks! What's a licking! That's just like a girl -- they're so
TOM thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain't going to tell
TOM old Dobbins on this little fool, because there's other ways of getting
TOM even on her, that ain't so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask
TOM who it was tore his book. Nobody'll answer. Then he'll do just the way
TOM he always does -- ask first one and then t'other, and when he comes to
TOM the right girl he'll know it, without any telling. Girls' faces always
TOM tell on them. They ain't got any backbone. She'll get licked. Well, it's
TOM a kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain't any way
TOM out of it.'' Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: ``All
TOM right, though; she'd like to see me in just such a fix -- let her sweat
TOM it out!''
TOM 
TOM Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the
TOM master arrived and school ``took in.'' Tom did not feel a strong
TOM interest in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls' side
TOM of the room Becky's face troubled him. Considering all things, he did
TOM not want to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He
TOM could get up no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently
TOM the spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom's mind was entirely full
TOM of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her
TOM lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She
TOM did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he
TOM spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only
TOM seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad
TOM of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she
TOM was not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse to
TOM get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced
TOM herself to keep still -- because, said she to herself, ``he'll tell
TOM about me tearing the picture sure. I wouldn't say a word, not to save
TOM his life!''
TOM 
TOM Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all
TOM broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly
TOM upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout --
TOM he had denied it for form's sake and because it was custom, and had
TOM stuck to the denial from principle.
TOM 
TOM A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air
TOM was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened
TOM himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,
TOM but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the
TOM pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched
TOM his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently
TOM for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!
TOM Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit
TOM look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot
TOM his quarrel with her. Quick -- something must be done! done in a flash,
TOM too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.
TOM Good! -- he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring
TOM through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little
TOM instant, and the chance was lost -- the master opened the volume. If Tom
TOM only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help
TOM for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.
TOM Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even the
TOM innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten -- the
TOM master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: ``Who tore this book?''
TOM 
TOM There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness
TOM continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.
TOM 
TOM ``Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?''
TOM 
TOM A denial. Another pause.
TOM 
TOM ``Joseph Harper, did you?''
TOM 
TOM Another denial. Tom's uneasiness grew more and more intense under the
TOM slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of boys
TOM -- considered a while, then turned to the girls:
TOM 
TOM ``Amy Lawrence?''
TOM 
TOM A shake of the head.
TOM 
TOM ``Gracie Miller?''
TOM 
TOM The same sign.
TOM 
TOM ``Susan Harper, did you do this?''
TOM 
TOM Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling
TOM from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the
TOM situation.
TOM 
TOM ``Rebecca Thatcher'' [Tom glanced at her face -- it was white with
TOM terror] -- ``did you tear -- no, look me in the face'' [her hands rose
TOM in appeal] -- ``did you tear this book?''
TOM 
TOM A thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang to his feet
TOM and shouted -- ``I done it!''
TOM 
TOM The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a
TOM moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward
TOM to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that
TOM shone upon him out of poor Becky's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred
TOM floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without an
TOM outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever
TOM administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a
TOM command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed -- for he
TOM knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not
TOM count the tedious time as loss, either.
TOM 
TOM Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for
TOM with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own
TOM treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to
TOM pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky's latest words
TOM lingering dreamily in his ear --
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, how COULD you be so noble!''
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XXI
TOM 
TOM VACATION was approaching. The school-master, always severe, grew severer
TOM and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good
TOM showing on ``Examination'' day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle
TOM now -- at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and
TOM young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins'
TOM lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under
TOM his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle
TOM age, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day
TOM approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he
TOM seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least
TOM shortcomings. The consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their
TOM days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge. They
TOM threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief. But he kept ahead
TOM all the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful success was
TOM so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field
TOM badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that
TOM promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the sign-painter's boy, told
TOM him the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own reasons for being
TOM delighted, for the master boarded in his father's family and had given
TOM the boy ample cause to hate him. The master's wife would go on a visit
TOM to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to interfere
TOM with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great occasions by
TOM getting pretty well fuddled, and the sign-painter's boy said that when
TOM the dominie had reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he
TOM would ``manage the thing'' while he napped in his chair; then he would
TOM have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school.
TOM 
TOM In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in the
TOM evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with
TOM wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in
TOM his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.
TOM He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and
TOM six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town
TOM and by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of
TOM citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the
TOM scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of
TOM small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;
TOM rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn
TOM and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their
TOM grandmothers' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and
TOM the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with
TOM non-participating scholars.
TOM 
TOM The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited,
TOM ``You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,''
TOM etc. -- accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic
TOM gestures which a machine might have used -- supposing the machine to be
TOM a trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared,
TOM and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and
TOM retired.
TOM 
TOM A little shamefaced girl lisped, ``Mary had a little lamb,'' etc.,
TOM performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and
TOM sat down flushed and happy.
TOM 
TOM Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the
TOM unquenchable and indestructible ``Give me liberty or give me death''
TOM speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the
TOM middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under
TOM him and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the
TOM house but he had the house's silence, too, which was even worse than its
TOM sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom
TOM struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak
TOM attempt at applause, but it died early.
TOM 
TOM ``The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck'' followed; also ``The Assyrian Came
TOM Down,'' and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,
TOM and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The
TOM prime feature of the evening was in order, now -- original
TOM ``compositions'' by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward
TOM to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript
TOM (tied with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention
TOM to ``expression'' and punctuation. The themes were the same that had
TOM been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them,
TOM their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line
TOM clear back to the Crusades. ``Friendship'' was one; ``Memories of Other
TOM Days''; ``Religion in History''; ``Dream Land''; ``The Advantages of
TOM Culture''; ``Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted'';
TOM ``Melancholy''; ``Filial Love''; ``Heart Longings,'' etc., etc.
TOM 
TOM A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted
TOM melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of ``fine
TOM language''; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly
TOM prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a
TOM peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate
TOM and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each
TOM and every one of them. No matter what the subject might be, a
TOM brain-racking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other
TOM that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification.
TOM The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass
TOM the banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient
TOM to-day; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps.
TOM There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel
TOM obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find
TOM that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in
TOM the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious. But
TOM enough of this. Homely truth is unpalatable.
TOM 
TOM Let us return to the ``Examination.'' The first composition that was
TOM read was one entitled ``Is this, then, Life?'' Perhaps the reader can
TOM endure an extract from it:
TOM 
TOM ``In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the
TOM youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity!
TOM Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the
TOM voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, 'the
TOM observed of all observers.' Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes,
TOM is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest,
TOM her step is lightest in the gay assembly.''
TOM 
TOM ``In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour
TOM arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has had
TOM such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her
TOM enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But
TOM after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is
TOM vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly
TOM upon her ear; the ball-room has lost its charms; and with wasted health
TOM and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly
TOM pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!''
TOM 
TOM And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to
TOM time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of ``How
TOM sweet!'' ``How eloquent!'' ``So true!'' etc., and after the thing had
TOM closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was
TOM enthusiastic.
TOM 
TOM Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the ``interesting''
TOM paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a ``poem.'' Two
TOM stanzas of it will do:
TOM 
TOM ``A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA''
TOM 
TOM ``Alabama, good-bye! I love thee well! But yet for a while do I leave
TOM thee now! Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell, And
TOM burning recollections throng my brow! For I have wandered through thy
TOM flowery woods; Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream; Have
TOM listened to Tallassee's warring floods, And wooed on Coosa's side
TOM Aurora's beam.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yet shame I not to bear an o'er-full heart, Nor blush to turn behind
TOM my tearful eyes; 'Tis from no stranger land I now must part, 'Tis to no
TOM strangers left I yield these sighs. Welcome and home were mine within
TOM this State, Whose vales I leave -- whose spires fade fast from me And
TOM cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete, When, dear Alabama! they
TOM turn cold on thee!''
TOM 
TOM There were very few there who knew what ``tete'' meant, but the poem was
TOM very satisfactory, nevertheless.
TOM 
TOM Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady,
TOM who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began
TOM to read in a measured, solemn tone:
TOM 
TOM ``A VISION''
TOM 
TOM ``Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single
TOM star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly
TOM vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry
TOM mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power
TOM exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous
TOM winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered
TOM about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.''
TOM 
TOM ``At such a time,so dark,so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit
TOM sighed; but instead thereof,''
TOM 
TOM ``'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide -- My joy in
TOM grief, my second bliss in joy,' came to my side. She moved like one of
TOM those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy's Eden by the
TOM romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own
TOM transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it failed to make even a
TOM sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as
TOM other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away un-perceived --
TOM unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features, like icy tears
TOM upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending elements
TOM without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.''
TOM 
TOM This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a
TOM sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the
TOM first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest
TOM effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize
TOM to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by
TOM far the most ``eloquent'' thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel
TOM Webster himself might well be proud of it.
TOM 
TOM It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which
TOM the word ``beauteous'' was over-fondled, and human experience referred
TOM to as ``life's page,'' was up to the usual average.
TOM 
TOM Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair
TOM aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of
TOM America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he
TOM made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter
TOM rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to
TOM right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted
TOM them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his
TOM entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down
TOM by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined
TOM he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly
TOM increased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with a
TOM scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat,
TOM suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about her
TOM head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she
TOM curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed at
TOM the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher -- the cat was
TOM within six inches of the absorbed teacher's head -- down, down, a little
TOM lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it,
TOM and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still
TOM in her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master's
TOM bald pate -- for the sign-painter's boy had GILDED it!
TOM 
TOM That broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.
TOM 
TOM NOTE:-- The pretended ``compositions'' quoted in this chapter are taken
TOM without alteration from a volume entitled ``Prose and Poetry, by a
TOM Western Lady'' -- but they are exactly and precisely after the
TOM schoolgirl pattern, and hence are much happier than any mere imitations
TOM could be.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XXII
TOM 
TOM TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the
TOM showy character of their ``regalia.'' He promised to abstain from
TOM smoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he
TOM found out a new thing -- namely, that to promise not to do a thing is
TOM the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very
TOM thing. Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and
TOM swear; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a
TOM chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from
TOM the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up -- gave
TOM it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours -- and
TOM fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was
TOM apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since he
TOM was so high an official. During three days Tom was deeply concerned
TOM about the Judge's condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his
TOM hopes ran high -- so high that he would venture to get out his regalia
TOM and practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had a most
TOM discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon the mend
TOM -- and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense of injury,
TOM too. He handed in his resignation at once -- and that night the Judge
TOM suffered a relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never trust a
TOM man like that again.
TOM 
TOM The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated
TOM to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however --
TOM there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now -- but found
TOM to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could,
TOM took the desire away, and the charm of it.
TOM 
TOM Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning
TOM to hang a little heavily on his hands.
TOM 
TOM He attempted a diary -- but nothing happened during three days, and so
TOM he abandoned it.
TOM 
TOM The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a
TOM sensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy
TOM for two days.
TOM 
TOM Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained
TOM hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man in
TOM the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States
TOM Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment -- for he was not
TOM twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.
TOM 
TOM A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents
TOM made of rag carpeting -- admission, three pins for boys, two for girls
TOM -- and then circusing was abandoned.
TOM 
TOM A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came -- and went again and left the
TOM village duller and drearier than ever.
TOM 
TOM There were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few and so
TOM delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.
TOM 
TOM Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her
TOM parents during vacation -- so there was no bright side to life anywhere.
TOM 
TOM The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very
TOM cancer for permanency and pain.
TOM 
TOM Then came the measles.
TOM 
TOM During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its
TOM happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got
TOM upon his feet at last and moved feebly down-town, a melancholy change
TOM had come over everything and every creature. There had been a
TOM ``revival,'' and everybody had ``got religion,'' not only the adults,
TOM but even the boys and girls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the
TOM sight of one blessed sinful face, but disappointment crossed him
TOM everywhere. He found Joe Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly
TOM away from the depressing spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him
TOM visiting the poor with a basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who
TOM called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a
TOM warning. Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression;
TOM and when, in desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of
TOM Huckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart
TOM broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the
TOM town was lost, forever and forever.
TOM 
TOM And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful
TOM claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head
TOM with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for
TOM he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him. He
TOM believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the
TOM extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have
TOM seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a
TOM battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the
TOM getting up such an expensive thunder-storm as this to knock the turf
TOM from under an insect like himself.
TOM 
TOM By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its
TOM object. The boy's first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His
TOM second was to wait -- for there might not be any more storms.
TOM 
TOM The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he
TOM spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad at
TOM last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how
TOM lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted
TOM listlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a
TOM juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her
TOM victim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a
TOM stolen melon. Poor lads! they -- like Tom -- had suffered a relapse.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XXIII
TOM 
TOM AT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred -- and vigorously: the murder
TOM trial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village
TOM talk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to the
TOM murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience and
TOM fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his
TOM hearing as ``feelers''; he did not see how he could be suspected of
TOM knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable
TOM in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time.
TOM He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some
TOM relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of
TOM distress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself
TOM that Huck had remained discreet.
TOM 
TOM ``Huck, have you ever told anybody about -- that?''
TOM 
TOM ``'Bout what?''
TOM 
TOM ``You know what.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh -- 'course I haven't.''
TOM 
TOM ``Never a word?''
TOM 
TOM ``Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I was afeard.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got found out.
TOM YOU know that.''
TOM 
TOM Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:
TOM 
TOM ``Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?''
TOM 
TOM ``Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that half-breed devil to drownd me
TOM they could get me to tell. They ain't no different way.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as we keep
TOM mum. But let's swear again, anyway. It's more surer.''
TOM 
TOM ``I'm agreed.''
TOM 
TOM So they swore again with dread solemnities.
TOM 
TOM ``What is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Talk? Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the
TOM time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so's I want to hide som'ers.''
TOM 
TOM ``That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a goner.
TOM Don't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?''
TOM 
TOM ``Most always -- most always. He ain't no account; but then he hain't
TOM ever done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money
TOM to get drunk on -- and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do
TOM that -- leastways most of us -- preachers and such like. But he's kind
TOM of good -- he give me half a fish, once, when there warn't enough for
TOM two; and lots of times he's kind of stood by me when I was out of
TOM luck.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, he's mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line.
TOM I wish we could get him out of there.''
TOM 
TOM ``My! we couldn't get him out, Tom. And besides, 'twouldn't do any good;
TOM they'd ketch him again.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes -- so they would. But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the
TOM dickens when he never done -- that.''
TOM 
TOM ``I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking villain
TOM in this country, and they wonder he wasn't ever hung before.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I've heard 'em say that if he
TOM was to get free they'd lynch him.''
TOM 
TOM ``And they'd do it, too.''
TOM 
TOM The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the
TOM twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood
TOM of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that
TOM something would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But
TOM nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in
TOM this luckless captive.
TOM 
TOM The boys did as they had often done before -- went to the cell grating
TOM and gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and
TOM there were no guards.
TOM 
TOM His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before
TOM -- it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and
TOM treacherous to the last degree when Potter said:
TOM 
TOM ``You've been mighty good to me, boys -- better'n anybody else in this
TOM town. And I don't forget it, I don't. Often I says to myself, says I, 'I
TOM used to mend all the boys' kites and things, and show 'em where the good
TOM fishin' places was, and befriend 'em what I could, and now they've all
TOM forgot old Muff when he's in trouble; but Tom don't, and Huck don't --
TOM THEY don't forget him, says I, 'and I don't forget them.' Well, boys, I
TOM done an awful thing -- drunk and crazy at the time -- that's the only
TOM way I account for it -- and now I got to swing for it, and it's right.
TOM Right, and BEST, too, I reckon -- hope so, anyway. Well, we won't talk
TOM about that. I don't want to make YOU feel bad; you've befriended me. But
TOM what I want to say, is, don't YOU ever get drunk -- then you won't ever
TOM get here. Stand a litter furder west -- so -- that's it; it's a prime
TOM comfort to see faces that's friendly when a body's in such a muck of
TOM trouble, and there don't none come here but yourn. Good friendly faces
TOM -- good friendly faces. Git up on one another's backs and let me touch
TOM 'em. That's it. Shake hands -- yourn'll come through the bars, but
TOM mine's too big. Little hands, and weak -- but they've helped Muff Potter
TOM a power, and they'd help him more if they could.''
TOM 
TOM Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.
TOM The next day and the day after, he hung about the court-room, drawn by
TOM an almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay
TOM out. Huck was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each
TOM other. Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal
TOM fascination always brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open
TOM when idlers sauntered out of the court-room, but invariably heard
TOM distressing news -- the toils were closing more and more relentlessly
TOM around poor Potter. At the end of the second day the village talk was to
TOM the effect that Injun Joe's evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that
TOM there was not the slightest question as to what the jury's verdict would
TOM be.
TOM 
TOM Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He was
TOM in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to
TOM sleep. All the village flocked to the court-house the next morning, for
TOM this was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented
TOM in the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took
TOM their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and
TOM hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all the
TOM curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,
TOM stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and
TOM the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings
TOM among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These
TOM details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation
TOM that was as impressive as it was fascinating.
TOM 
TOM Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing
TOM in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was
TOM discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further
TOM questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:
TOM 
TOM ``Take the witness.''
TOM 
TOM The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when
TOM his own counsel said:
TOM 
TOM ``I have no questions to ask him.''
TOM 
TOM The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.
TOM Counsel for the prosecution said:
TOM 
TOM ``Take the witness.''
TOM 
TOM ``I have no questions to ask him,'' Potter's lawyer replied.
TOM 
TOM A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter's
TOM possession.
TOM 
TOM ``Take the witness.''
TOM 
TOM Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience
TOM began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his
TOM client's life without an effort?
TOM 
TOM Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter's guilty behavior when
TOM brought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand
TOM without being cross-questioned.
TOM 
TOM Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the
TOM graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was
TOM brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined
TOM by Potter's lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house
TOM expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.
TOM Counsel for the prosecution now said:
TOM 
TOM ``By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have
TOM fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the
TOM unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.''
TOM 
TOM A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and
TOM rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned in
TOM the court-room. Many men were moved, and many women's compassion
TOM testified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we
TOM foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed
TOM while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced
TOM by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea.''
TOM [Then to the clerk:] ``Call Thomas Sawyer!''
TOM 
TOM A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting
TOM Potter's. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as
TOM he rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough,
TOM for he was badly scared. The oath was administered.
TOM 
TOM ``Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the
TOM hour of midnight?''
TOM 
TOM Tom glanced at Injun Joe's iron face and his tongue failed him. The
TOM audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few
TOM moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed
TOM to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:
TOM 
TOM ``In the graveyard!''
TOM 
TOM ``A little bit louder, please. Don't be afraid. You were --''
TOM 
TOM ``In the graveyard.''
TOM 
TOM A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe's face.
TOM 
TOM ``Were you anywhere near Horse Williams' grave?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, sir.''
TOM 
TOM ``Speak up -- just a trifle louder. How near were you?''
TOM 
TOM ``Near as I am to you.''
TOM 
TOM ``Were you hidden, or not?''
TOM 
TOM ``I was hid.''
TOM 
TOM ``Where?''
TOM 
TOM ``Behind the elms that's on the edge of the grave.''
TOM 
TOM Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.
TOM 
TOM ``Any one with you?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, sir. I went there with --''
TOM 
TOM ``Wait -- wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion's name. We
TOM will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with
TOM you.''
TOM 
TOM Tom hesitated and looked confused.
TOM 
TOM ``Speak out, my boy -- don't be diffident. The truth is always
TOM respectable. What did you take there?''
TOM 
TOM ``Only a -- a -- dead cat.''
TOM 
TOM There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.
TOM 
TOM ``We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us
TOM everything that occurred -- tell it in your own way -- don't skip
TOM anything, and don't be afraid.''
TOM 
TOM Tom began -- hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his
TOM words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased
TOM but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and
TOM bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time,
TOM rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent
TOM emotion reached its climax when the boy said:
TOM 
TOM ``-- and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell,
TOM Injun Joe jumped with the knife and --''
TOM 
TOM Crash! Quick as lightning the half-breed sprang for a window, tore his
TOM way through all opposers, and was gone!
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XXIV
TOM 
TOM TOM was a glittering hero once more -- the pet of the old, the envy of
TOM the young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper
TOM magnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet,
TOM if he escaped hanging.
TOM 
TOM As usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom
TOM and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort
TOM of conduct is to the world's credit; therefore it is not well to find
TOM fault with it.
TOM 
TOM Tom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights
TOM were seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always
TOM with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to
TOM stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of
TOM wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer
TOM the night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid
TOM that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding
TOM Injun Joe's flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.
TOM The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of
TOM that? Since Tom's harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the
TOM lawyer's house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been
TOM sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck's
TOM confidence in the human race was well-nigh obliterated.
TOM 
TOM Daily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly
TOM he wished he had sealed up his tongue.
TOM 
TOM Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the
TOM other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a
TOM safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.
TOM 
TOM Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun Joe
TOM was found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a
TOM detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked
TOM wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that
TOM craft usually achieve. That is to say, he ``found a clew.'' But you
TOM can't hang a ``clew'' for murder, and so after that detective had got
TOM through and gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.
TOM 
TOM The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened
TOM weight of apprehension.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XXV
TOM 
TOM THERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy's life when he has a
TOM raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire
TOM suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find Joe Harper, but
TOM failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing.
TOM Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would answer.
TOM Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him
TOM confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand
TOM in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital,
TOM for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is
TOM not money. ``Where'll we dig?'' said Huck.
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, most anywhere.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, is it hid all around?''
TOM 
TOM ``No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places, Huck --
TOM sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb
TOM of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but mostly
TOM under the floor in ha'nted houses.''
TOM 
TOM ``Who hides it?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, robbers, of course -- who'd you reckon? Sunday-school
TOM sup'rintendents?''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't know. If 'twas mine I wouldn't hide it; I'd spend it and have
TOM a good time.''
TOM 
TOM ``So would I. But robbers don't do that way. They always hide it and
TOM leave it there.''
TOM 
TOM ``Don't they come after it any more?''
TOM 
TOM ``No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else
TOM they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and
TOM by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks
TOM -- a paper that's got to be ciphered over about a week because it's
TOM mostly signs and hy'roglyphics.''
TOM 
TOM ``HyroQwhich?''
TOM 
TOM ``Hy'roglyphics -- pictures and things, you know, that don't seem to
TOM mean anything.''
TOM 
TOM ``Have you got one of them papers, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM ``No.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well then, how you going to find the marks?''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't want any marks. They always bury it under a ha'nted house or
TOM on an island, or under a dead tree that's got one limb sticking out.
TOM Well, we've tried Jackson's Island a little, and we can try it again
TOM some time; and there's the old ha'nted house up the Still-House branch,
TOM and there's lots of deadlimb trees -- dead loads of 'em.''
TOM 
TOM ``Is it under all of them?''
TOM 
TOM ``How you talk! No!''
TOM 
TOM ``Then how you going to know which one to go for?''
TOM 
TOM ``Go for all of 'em!''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, Tom, it'll take all summer.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred
TOM dollars in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di'monds.
TOM How's that?''
TOM 
TOM Huck's eyes glowed.
TOM 
TOM ``That's bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred
TOM dollars and I don't want no di'monds.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right. But I bet you I ain't going to throw off on di'monds. Some
TOM of 'em's worth twenty dollars apiece -- there ain't any, hardly, but's
TOM worth six bits or a dollar.''
TOM 
TOM ``No! Is that so?''
TOM 
TOM ``Cert'nly -- anybody'll tell you so. Hain't you ever seen one, Huck?''
TOM 
TOM ``Not as I remember.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, kings have slathers of them.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I don' know no kings, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``I reckon you don't. But if you was to go to Europe you'd see a raft of
TOM 'em hopping around.''
TOM 
TOM ``Do they hop?''
TOM 
TOM ``Hop? -- your granny! No!''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, what did you say they did, for?''
TOM 
TOM ``Shucks, I only meant you'd SEE 'em -- not hopping, of course -- what
TOM do they want to hop for? -- but I mean you'd just see 'em -- scattered
TOM around, you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked
TOM Richard.''
TOM 
TOM ``Richard? What's his other name?''
TOM 
TOM ``He didn't have any other name. Kings don't have any but a given
TOM name.''
TOM 
TOM ``No?''
TOM 
TOM ``But they don't.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don't want to be a king
TOM and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say -- where you
TOM going to dig first?''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I don't know. S'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the
TOM hill t'other side of Still-House branch?''
TOM 
TOM ``I'm agreed.''
TOM 
TOM So they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their
TOM three-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves
TOM down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.
TOM 
TOM ``I like this,'' said Tom.
TOM 
TOM ``So do I.''
TOM 
TOM ``Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your
TOM share?''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I'll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I'll go to
TOM every circus that comes along. I bet I'll have a gay time.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, ain't you going to save any of it?''
TOM 
TOM ``Save it? What for?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, that ain't any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day
TOM and get his claws on it if I didn't hurry up, and I tell you he'd clean
TOM it out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM ``I'm going to buy a new drum, and a sure-'nough sword, and a red
TOM necktie and a bull pup, and get married.''
TOM 
TOM ``Married!''
TOM 
TOM ``That's it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, you -- why, you ain't in your right mind.''
TOM 
TOM ``Wait -- you'll see.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, that's the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my
TOM mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty
TOM well.''
TOM 
TOM ``That ain't anything. The girl I'm going to marry won't fight.''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, I reckon they're all alike. They'll all comb a body. Now you
TOM better think 'bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What's the name
TOM of the gal?''
TOM 
TOM ``It ain't a gal at all -- it's a girl.''
TOM 
TOM ``It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl -- both's
TOM right, like enough. Anyway, what's her name, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM ``I'll tell you some time -- not now.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right -- that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be more
TOM lonesomer than ever.''
TOM 
TOM ``No you won't. You'll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and
TOM we'll go to digging.''
TOM 
TOM They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another
TOM half-hour. Still no result. Huck said:
TOM 
TOM ``Do they always bury it as deep as this?''
TOM 
TOM ``Sometimes -- not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven't got the
TOM right place.''
TOM 
TOM So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little,
TOM but still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time.
TOM Finally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his
TOM brow with his sleeve, and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?''
TOM 
TOM ``I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder on Cardiff
TOM Hill back of the widow's.''
TOM 
TOM ``I reckon that'll be a good one. But won't the widow take it away from
TOM us, Tom? It's on her land.''
TOM 
TOM ``SHE take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever finds one
TOM of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don't make any difference
TOM whose land it's on.''
TOM 
TOM That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:
TOM 
TOM ``Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?''
TOM 
TOM ``It is mighty curious, Huck. I don't understand it. Sometimes witches
TOM interfere. I reckon maybe that's what's the trouble now.''
TOM 
TOM ``Shucks! Witches ain't got no power in the daytime.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, that's so. I didn't think of that. Oh, I know what the matter
TOM is! What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the
TOM shadow of the limb falls at midnight, and that's where you dig!''
TOM 
TOM ``Then consound it, we've fooled away all this work for nothing. Now
TOM hang it all, we got to come back in the night. It's an awful long way.
TOM Can you get out?''
TOM 
TOM ``I bet I will. We've got to do it to-night, too, because if somebody
TOM sees these holes they'll know in a minute what's here and they'll go for
TOM it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I'll come around and maow to-night.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes.''
TOM 
TOM The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in
TOM the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by
TOM old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked
TOM in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the
TOM distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were
TOM subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged
TOM that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to
TOM dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and
TOM their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened,
TOM but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon
TOM something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone
TOM or a chunk. At last Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, but we CAN'T be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.''
TOM 
TOM ``I know it, but then there's another thing.''
TOM 
TOM ``What's that?''.
TOM 
TOM ``Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too
TOM early.''
TOM 
TOM Huck dropped his shovel.
TOM 
TOM ``That's it,'' said he. ``That's the very trouble. We got to give this
TOM one up. We can't ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of
TOM thing's too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts
TOM a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something's behind me all the time;
TOM and I'm afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there's others in front
TOM a-waiting for a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got
TOM here.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a
TOM dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Lordy!''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, they do. I've always heard that.''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, I don't like to fool around much where there's dead people. A
TOM body's bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure.''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was to stick
TOM his skull out and say something!''
TOM 
TOM ``Don't Tom! It's awful.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit.''
TOM 
TOM ``Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres else.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right, I reckon we better.''
TOM 
TOM ``What'll it be?''
TOM 
TOM Tom considered awhile; and then said:
TOM 
TOM ``The ha'nted house. That's it!''
TOM 
TOM ``Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern sight
TOM worse'n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don't come
TOM sliding around in a shroud, when you ain't noticing, and peep over your
TOM shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I
TOM couldn't stand such a thing as that, Tom -- nobody could.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They won't
TOM hender us from digging there in the daytime.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about that
TOM ha'nted house in the day nor the night.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's been
TOM murdered, anyway -- but nothing's ever been seen around that house
TOM except in the night -- just some blue lights slipping by the windows --
TOM no regular ghosts.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom,
TOM you can bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason.
TOM Becuz you know that they don't anybody but ghosts use 'em.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the daytime, so
TOM what's the use of our being afeard?''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so -- but I
TOM reckon it's taking chances.''
TOM 
TOM They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the
TOM moonlit valley below them stood the ``ha'nted'' house, utterly isolated,
TOM its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the
TOM chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof
TOM caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit
TOM past a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the
TOM circumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted
TOM house a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that
TOM adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XXVI
TOM 
TOM ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come
TOM for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was
TOM measurably so, also -- but suddenly said:
TOM 
TOM ``Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?''
TOM 
TOM Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his
TOM eyes with a startled look in them --
TOM 
TOM ``My! I never once thought of it, Huck!''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was
TOM Friday.''
TOM 
TOM ``Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might 'a' got into an
TOM awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.''
TOM 
TOM ``MIGHT! Better say we WOULD! There's some lucky days, maybe, but Friday
TOM ain't.''
TOM 
TOM ``Any fool knows that. I don't reckon YOU was the first that found it
TOM out, Huck.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain't all, neither. I had
TOM a rotten bad dream last night -- dreampt about rats.''
TOM 
TOM ``No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?''
TOM 
TOM ``No.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, that's good, Huck. When they don't fight it's only a sign that
TOM there's trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty
TOM sharp and keep out of it. We'll drop this thing for to-day, and play. Do
TOM you know Robin Hood, Huck?''
TOM 
TOM ``No. Who's Robin Hood?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England -- and
TOM the best. He was a robber.''
TOM 
TOM ``Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?''
TOM 
TOM ``Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like.
TOM But he never bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He always divided up with
TOM 'em perfectly square.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, he must 'a' been a brick.''
TOM 
TOM ``I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was. They
TOM ain't any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in
TOM England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow
TOM and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.''
TOM 
TOM ``What's a YEW bow?''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't know. It's some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that
TOM dime only on the edge he would set down and cry -- and curse. But we'll
TOM play Robin Hood -- it's nobby fun. I'll learn you.''
TOM 
TOM ``I'm agreed.''
TOM 
TOM So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a
TOM yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the
TOM morrow's prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink
TOM into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of
TOM the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff
TOM Hill.
TOM 
TOM On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.
TOM They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their
TOM last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were
TOM so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down
TOM within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and
TOM turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this
TOM time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling
TOM that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the
TOM requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.
TOM 
TOM When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and
TOM grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,
TOM and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the
TOM place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they
TOM crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weed-grown,
TOM floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a
TOM ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and
TOM abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened
TOM pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,
TOM and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.
TOM 
TOM In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the
TOM place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own
TOM boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look up-stairs.
TOM This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring each
TOM other, and of course there could be but one result -- they threw their
TOM tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of
TOM decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the
TOM promise was a fraud -- there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now
TOM and well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when --
TOM 
TOM ``Sh!'' said Tom.
TOM 
TOM ``What is it?'' whispered Huck, blanching with fright.
TOM 
TOM ``Sh! ... There! ... Hear it?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes! ... Oh, my! Let's run!''
TOM 
TOM ``Keep still! Don't you budge! They're coming right toward the door.''
TOM 
TOM The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to
TOM knot-holes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.
TOM 
TOM ``They've stopped.... No -- coming.... Here they are. Don't whisper
TOM another word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!''
TOM 
TOM Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: ``There's the old deaf and
TOM dumb Spaniard that's been about town once or twice lately -- never saw
TOM t'other man before.''
TOM 
TOM ``T'other'' was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant
TOM in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white
TOM whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore
TOM green goggles. When they came in, ``t'other'' was talking in a low
TOM voice; they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to
TOM the wall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less
TOM guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:
TOM 
TOM ``No,'' said he, ``I've thought it all over, and I don't like it. It's
TOM dangerous.''
TOM 
TOM ``Dangerous!'' grunted the ``deaf and dumb'' Spaniard -- to the vast
TOM surprise of the boys. ``Milksop!''
TOM 
TOM This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe's! There was
TOM silence for some time. Then Joe said:
TOM 
TOM ``What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder -- but nothing's
TOM come of it.''
TOM 
TOM ``That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.
TOM 'Twon't ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn't
TOM succeed.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, what's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime! --
TOM anybody would suspicion us that saw us.''
TOM 
TOM ``I know that. But there warn't any other place as handy after that fool
TOM of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it
TOM warn't any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys
TOM playing over there on the hill right in full view.''
TOM 
TOM ``Those infernal boys'' quaked again under the inspiration of this
TOM remark, and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was
TOM Friday and concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had
TOM waited a year.
TOM 
TOM The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and
TOM thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:
TOM 
TOM ``Look here, lad -- you go back up the river where you belong. Wait
TOM there till you hear from me. I'll take the chances on dropping into this
TOM town just once more, for a look. We'll do that 'dangerous' job after
TOM I've spied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for
TOM Texas! We'll leg it together!''
TOM 
TOM This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe
TOM said:
TOM 
TOM ``I'm dead for sleep! It's your turn to watch.''
TOM 
TOM He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred
TOM him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to
TOM nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.
TOM 
TOM The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:
TOM 
TOM ``Now's our chance -- come!''
TOM 
TOM Huck said:
TOM 
TOM ``I can't -- I'd die if they was to wake.''
TOM 
TOM Tom urged -- Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and
TOM started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak
TOM from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never
TOM made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments
TOM till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray;
TOM and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.
TOM 
TOM Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around -- smiled grimly
TOM upon his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees -- stirred him
TOM up with his foot and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Here! YOU'RE a watchman, ain't you! All right, though -- nothing's
TOM happened.''
TOM 
TOM ``My! have I been asleep?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What'll we
TOM do with what little swag we've got left?''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't know -- leave it here as we've always done, I reckon. No use
TOM to take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver's
TOM something to carry.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well -- all right -- it won't matter to come here once more.''
TOM 
TOM ``No -- but I'd say come in the night as we used to do -- it's better.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right
TOM chance at that job; accidents might happen; 'tain't in such a very good
TOM place; we'll just regularly bury it -- and bury it deep.''
TOM 
TOM ``Good idea,'' said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,
TOM raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled
TOM pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself
TOM and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on
TOM his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.
TOM 
TOM The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With
TOM gloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck! -- the splendor of it
TOM was beyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make
TOM half a dozen boys rich! Here was treasurehunting under the happiest
TOM auspices -- there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to
TOM dig. They nudged each other every moment -- eloquent nudges and easily
TOM understood, for they simply meant -- ``Oh, but ain't you glad NOW we're
TOM here!''
TOM 
TOM Joe's knife struck upon something.
TOM 
TOM ``Hello!'' said he.
TOM 
TOM ``What is it?'' said his comrade.
TOM 
TOM ``Half-rotten plank -- no, it's a box, I believe. Here -- bear a hand
TOM and we'll see what it's here for. Never mind, I've broke a hole.''
TOM 
TOM He reached his hand in and drew it out --
TOM 
TOM ``Man, it's money!''
TOM 
TOM The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys
TOM above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.
TOM 
TOM Joe's comrade said:
TOM 
TOM ``We'll make quick work of this. There's an old rusty pick over amongst
TOM the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace -- I saw it a
TOM minute ago.''
TOM 
TOM He ran and brought the boys' pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the pick,
TOM looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to
TOM himself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was
TOM not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the
TOM slow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in
TOM blissful silence.
TOM 
TOM ``Pard, there's thousands of dollars here,'' said Injun Joe.
TOM 
TOM ``'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used to be around here one
TOM summer,'' the stranger observed.
TOM 
TOM ``I know it,'' said Injun Joe; ``and this looks like it, I should say.''
TOM 
TOM ``Now you won't need to do that job.''
TOM 
TOM The half-breed frowned. Said he:
TOM 
TOM ``You don't know me. Least you don't know all about that thing. 'Tain't
TOM robbery altogether -- it's REVENGE!'' and a wicked light flamed in his
TOM eyes. ``I'll need your help in it. When it's finished -- then Texas. Go
TOM home to your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well -- if you say so; what'll we do with this -- bury it again?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] NO! by the great Sachem, no!
TOM [Profound distress overhead.] I'd nearly forgot. That pick had fresh
TOM earth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business
TOM has a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on them?
TOM Who brought them here -- and where are they gone? Have you heard
TOM anybody? -- seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and
TOM see the ground disturbed? Not exactly -- not exactly. We'll take it to
TOM my den.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number
TOM One?''
TOM 
TOM ``No -- Number Two -- under the cross. The other place is bad -- too
TOM common.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right. It's nearly dark enough to start.''
TOM 
TOM Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping
TOM out. Presently he said:
TOM 
TOM ``Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be
TOM up-stairs?''
TOM 
TOM The boys' breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,
TOM halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The
TOM boys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came
TOM creaking up the stairs -- the intolerable distress of the situation woke
TOM the stricken resolution of the lads -- they were about to spring for the
TOM closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on
TOM the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself
TOM up cursing, and his comrade said:
TOM 
TOM ``Now what's the use of all that? If it's anybody, and they're up there,
TOM let them STAY there -- who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and
TOM get into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes -- and
TOM then let them follow us if they want to. I'm willing. In my opinion,
TOM whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for
TOM ghosts or devils or something. I'll bet they're running yet.''
TOM 
TOM Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight
TOM was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.
TOM Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening
TOM twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.
TOM 
TOM Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them
TOM through the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They
TOM were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the
TOM townward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much
TOM absorbed in hating themselves -- hating the ill luck that made them take
TOM the spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would have
TOM suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there
TOM till his ``revenge'' was satisfied, and then he would have had the
TOM misfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that
TOM the tools were ever brought there!
TOM 
TOM They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to
TOM town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to
TOM ``Number Two,'' wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred
TOM to Tom.
TOM 
TOM ``Revenge? What if he means US, Huck!''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, don't!'' said Huck, nearly fainting.
TOM 
TOM They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe
TOM that he might possibly mean somebody else -- at least that he might at
TOM least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.
TOM 
TOM Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company
TOM would be a palpable improvement, he thought.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XXVII
TOM 
TOM THE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom's dreams that night.
TOM Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it
TOM wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and
TOM wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay
TOM in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he
TOM noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away -- somewhat as
TOM if they had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then
TOM it occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream!
TOM There was one very strong argument in favor of this idea -- namely, that
TOM the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never
TOM seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all
TOM boys of his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all
TOM references to ``hundreds'' and ``thousands'' were mere fanciful forms of
TOM speech, and that no such sums really existed in the world. He never had
TOM supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be
TOM found in actual money in any one's possession. If his notions of hidden
TOM treasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a
TOM handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable
TOM dollars.
TOM 
TOM But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer
TOM under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found
TOM himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a
TOM dream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a
TOM hurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale
TOM of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking
TOM very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If he
TOM did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a
TOM dream.
TOM 
TOM ``Hello, Huck!''
TOM 
TOM ``Hello, yourself.''
TOM 
TOM Silence, for a minute.
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, if we'd 'a' left the blame tools at the dead tree, we'd 'a' got
TOM the money. Oh, ain't it awful!''
TOM 
TOM ``'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.
TOM Dog'd if I don't, Huck.''
TOM 
TOM ``What ain't a dream?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.''
TOM 
TOM ``Dream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how much dream
TOM it was! I've had dreams enough all night -- with that patch-eyed Spanish
TOM devil going for me all through 'em -- rot him!''
TOM 
TOM ``No, not rot him. FIND him! Track the money!''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, we'll never find him. A feller don't have only one chance for
TOM such a pile -- and that one's lost. I'd feel mighty shaky if I was to
TOM see him, anyway.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, so'd I; but I'd like to see him, anyway -- and track him out --
TOM to his Number Two.''
TOM 
TOM ``Number Two -- yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that. But I can't
TOM make nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?''
TOM 
TOM ``I dono. It's too deep. Say, Huck -- maybe it's the number of a
TOM house!''
TOM 
TOM ``Goody! ... No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this
TOM one-horse town. They ain't no numbers here.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here -- it's the number of a
TOM room -- in a tavern, you know!''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, that's the trick! They ain't only two taverns. We can find out
TOM quick.''
TOM 
TOM ``You stay here, Huck, till I come.''
TOM 
TOM Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck's company in public
TOM places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No.
TOM 2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.
TOM In the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper's
TOM young son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody
TOM go into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any
TOM particular reason for this state of things; had had some little
TOM curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery by
TOM entertaining himself with the idea that that room was ``ha'nted''; had
TOM noticed that there was a light in there the night before.
TOM 
TOM ``That's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very No. 2 we're
TOM after.''
TOM 
TOM ``I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?''
TOM 
TOM ``Lemme think.''
TOM 
TOM Tom thought a long time. Then he said:
TOM 
TOM ``I'll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out
TOM into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap
TOM of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the door-keys you can find,
TOM and I'll nip all of auntie's, and the first dark night we'll go there
TOM and try 'em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said
TOM he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to
TOM get his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don't go
TOM to that No. 2, that ain't the place.''
TOM 
TOM ``Lordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you -- and if he did,
TOM maybe he'd never think anything.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, if it's pretty dark I reckon I'll track him. I dono -- I dono.
TOM I'll try.''
TOM 
TOM ``You bet I'll follow him, if it's dark, Huck. Why, he might 'a' found
TOM out he couldn't get his revenge, and be going right after that money.''
TOM 
TOM ``It's so, Tom, it's so. I'll foller him; I will, by jingoes!''
TOM 
TOM ``Now you're TALKING! Don't you ever weaken, Huck, and I won't.''
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XXVIII
TOM 
TOM THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about
TOM the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley
TOM at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or
TOM left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern door.
TOM The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the
TOM understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck
TOM was to come and ``maow,'' whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.
TOM But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to
TOM bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.
TOM 
TOM Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday
TOM night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt's
TOM old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the
TOM lantern in Huck's sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before
TOM midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts)
TOM were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the
TOM alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned, the
TOM perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of
TOM distant thunder.
TOM 
TOM Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the
TOM towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.
TOM Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was a
TOM season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck's spirits like a
TOM mountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern -- it
TOM would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive
TOM yet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have
TOM fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and
TOM excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer and
TOM closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and
TOM momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away
TOM his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to
TOM inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the
TOM way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came
TOM tearing by him: . ``Run!'' said he; ``run, for your life!''
TOM 
TOM He needn't have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or
TOM forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never
TOM stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the
TOM lower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm
TOM burst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:
TOM 
TOM ``Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;
TOM but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't hardly
TOM get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn't turn in the lock, either.
TOM Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and
TOM open comes the door! It warn't locked! I hopped in, and shook off the
TOM towel, and, GREAT CAESAR'S GHOST!''
TOM 
TOM ``What! -- what'd you see, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM ``Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!''
TOM 
TOM ``No!''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch
TOM on his eye and his arms spread out.''
TOM 
TOM ``Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?''
TOM 
TOM ``No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and
TOM started!''
TOM 
TOM ``I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Say, Tom, did you see that box?''
TOM 
TOM ``Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I didn't see
TOM the cross. I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor
TOM by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.
TOM Don't you see, now, what's the matter with that ha'nted room?''
TOM 
TOM ``How?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, it's ha'nted with whiskey! Maybe ALL the Temperance Taverns have
TOM got a ha'nted room, hey, Huck?''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing? But
TOM say, Tom, now's a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe's
TOM drunk.''
TOM 
TOM ``It is, that! You try it!''
TOM 
TOM Huck shuddered.
TOM 
TOM ``Well, no -- I reckon not.''
TOM 
TOM ``And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle along-side of Injun Joe ain't
TOM enough. If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd do it.''
TOM 
TOM There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun
TOM Joe's not in there. It's too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we'll
TOM be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we'll
TOM snatch that box quicker'n lightning.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do it
TOM every night, too, if you'll do the other part of the job.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a
TOM block and maow -- and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel at the window
TOM and that'll fetch me.''
TOM 
TOM ``Agreed, and good as wheat!''
TOM 
TOM ``Now, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home. It'll begin to be
TOM daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will
TOM you?''
TOM 
TOM ``I said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every night
TOM for a year! I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all night.''
TOM 
TOM ``That's all right. Now, where you going to sleep?''
TOM 
TOM ``In Ben Rogers' hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap's nigger man,
TOM Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any
TOM time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.
TOM That's a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don't ever act as
TOM if I was above him. Sometime I've set right down and eat WITH him. But
TOM you needn't tell that. A body's got to do things when he's awful hungry
TOM he wouldn't want to do as a steady thing.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep. I won't
TOM come bothering around. Any time you see something's up, in the night,
TOM just skip right around and maow.''
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XXIX
TOM 
TOM THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of news --
TOM Judge Thatcher's family had come back to town the night before. Both
TOM Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment,
TOM and Becky took the chief place in the boy's interest. He saw her and
TOM they had an exhausting good time playing ``hispy'' and ``gully-keeper''
TOM with a crowd of their school-mates. The day was completed and crowned in
TOM a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint the
TOM next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she
TOM consented. The child's delight was boundless; and Tom's not more
TOM moderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway
TOM the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation
TOM and pleasurable anticipation. Tom's excitement enabled him to keep awake
TOM until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck's
TOM ``maow,'' and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the
TOM picnickers with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that
TOM night.
TOM 
TOM Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and
TOM rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and everything was
TOM ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the
TOM picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough
TOM under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young
TOM gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was
TOM chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main
TOM street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss the
TOM fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.
TOM Thatcher said to Becky, was:
TOM 
TOM ``You'll not get back till late. Perhaps you'd better stay all night
TOM with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.''
TOM 
TOM ``Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.''
TOM 
TOM ``Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don't be any trouble.''
TOM 
TOM Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:
TOM 
TOM ``Say -- I'll tell you what we'll do. 'Stead of going to Joe Harper's
TOM we'll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas'. She'll
TOM have ice-cream! She has it most every day -- dead loads of it. And
TOM she'll be awful glad to have us.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, that will be fun!''
TOM 
TOM Then Becky reflected a moment and said:
TOM 
TOM ``But what will mamma say?''
TOM 
TOM ``How'll she ever know?''
TOM 
TOM The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:
TOM 
TOM ``I reckon it's wrong -- but --''
TOM 
TOM ``But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All she
TOM wants is that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go there if
TOM she'd 'a' thought of it. I know she would!''
TOM 
TOM The Widow Douglas' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and
TOM Tom's persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say
TOM nothing anybody about the night's programme. Presently it occurred to
TOM Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The
TOM thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he
TOM could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas'. And why should he
TOM give it up, he reasoned -- the signal did not come the night before, so
TOM why should it be any more likely to come to-night? The sure fun of the
TOM evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined
TOM to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of
TOM the box of money another time that day.
TOM 
TOM Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody
TOM hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest
TOM distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and
TOM laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone
TOM through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified
TOM with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things
TOM began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in
TOM the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:
TOM 
TOM ``Who's ready for the cave?''
TOM 
TOM Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there
TOM was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the
TOM hillside -- an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door
TOM stood unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an ice-house, and
TOM walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat.
TOM It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look
TOM out upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of
TOM the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment
TOM a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a
TOM struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked
TOM down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a
TOM new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went
TOM filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of
TOM lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of
TOM junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than eight
TOM or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower
TOM crevices branched from it on either hand -- for McDougal's cave was but
TOM a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out
TOM again and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights
TOM together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never
TOM find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and still
TOM down, into the earth, and it was just the same -- labyrinth under
TOM labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man ``knew'' the cave. That was
TOM an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it
TOM was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer
TOM knew as much of the cave as any one.
TOM 
TOM The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a
TOM mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch
TOM avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise
TOM at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude
TOM each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the
TOM ``known'' ground.
TOM 
TOM By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of
TOM the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow
TOM drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of
TOM the day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no
TOM note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had
TOM been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day's
TOM adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat
TOM with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for
TOM the wasted time but the captain of the craft.
TOM 
TOM Huck was already upon his watch when the ferry-boat's lights went
TOM glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young
TOM people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly
TOM tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not stop
TOM at the wharf -- and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his
TOM attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten
TOM o'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began
TOM to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village
TOM betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the
TOM silence and the ghosts. Eleven o'clock came, and the tavern lights were
TOM put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long
TOM time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?
TOM Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?
TOM 
TOM A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley
TOM door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next
TOM moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under
TOM his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure.
TOM Why call Tom now? It would be absurd -- the men would get away with the
TOM box and never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and
TOM follow them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery.
TOM So communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the
TOM men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough
TOM ahead not to be invisible.
TOM 
TOM They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up
TOM a cross-street. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the
TOM path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old
TOM Welshman's house, half-way up the hill, without hesitating, and still
TOM climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.
TOM But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit.
TOM They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and
TOM were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his
TOM distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along
TOM awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved
TOM on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that
TOM he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an owl
TOM came over the hill -- ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was
TOM everything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man
TOM cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck's heart shot into his
TOM throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as if
TOM a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he
TOM thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He knew
TOM he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas'
TOM grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won't be hard
TOM to find.
TOM 
TOM Now there was a voice -- a very low voice -- Injun Joe's:
TOM 
TOM ``Damn her, maybe she's got company -- there's lights, late as it is.''
TOM 
TOM ``I can't see any.''
TOM 
TOM This was that stranger's voice -- the stranger of the haunted house. A
TOM deadly chill went to Huck's heart -- this, then, was the ``revenge''
TOM job! His thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas
TOM had been kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to
TOM murder her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he
TOM didn't dare -- they might come and catch him. He thought all this and
TOM more in the moment that elapsed between the stranger's remark and Injun
TOM Joe's next -- which was --
TOM 
TOM ``Because the bush is in your way. Now -- this way -- now you see, don't
TOM you?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes. Well, there IS company there, I reckon. Better give it up.''
TOM 
TOM ``Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and
TOM maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I've told you
TOM before, I don't care for her swag -- you may have it. But her husband
TOM was rough on me -- many times he was rough on me -- and mainly he was
TOM the justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain't
TOM all. It ain't a millionth part of it! He had me HORSEWHIPPED! --
TOM horsewhipped in front of the jail, like a nigger! -- with all the town
TOM looking on! HORSEWHIPPED! -- do you understand? He took advantage of me
TOM and died. But I'll take it out of HER.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, don't kill her! Don't do that!''
TOM 
TOM ``Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill HIM if he was
TOM here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don't
TOM kill her -- bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils -- you
TOM notch her ears like a sow!''
TOM 
TOM ``By God, that's --''
TOM 
TOM ``Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I'll tie her
TOM to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I'll not cry, if
TOM she does. My friend, you'll help me in this thing -- for MY sake --
TOM that's why you're here -- I mightn't be able alone. If you flinch, I'll
TOM kill you. Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I'll kill
TOM her -- and then I reckon nobody'll ever know much about who done this
TOM business.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, if it's got to be done, let's get at it. The quicker the better
TOM -- I'm all in a shiver.''
TOM 
TOM ``Do it NOW? And company there? Look here -- I'll get suspicious of you,
TOM first thing you know. No -- we'll wait till the lights are out --
TOM there's no hurry.''
TOM 
TOM Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue -- a thing still more awful
TOM than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped
TOM gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,
TOM one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one
TOM side and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same
TOM elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and -- a twig
TOM snapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no
TOM sound -- the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now
TOM he turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes -- turned
TOM himself as carefully as if he were a ship -- and then stepped quickly
TOM but cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and
TOM so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he
TOM reached the Welshman's. He banged at the door, and presently the heads
TOM of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.
TOM 
TOM ``What's the row there? Who's banging? What do you want?''
TOM 
TOM ``Let me in -- quick! I'll tell everything.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, who are you?''
TOM 
TOM ``Huckleberry Finn -- quick, let me in!''
TOM 
TOM ``Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain't a name to open many doors, I judge!
TOM But let him in, lads, and let's see what's the trouble.''
TOM 
TOM ``Please don't ever tell I told you,'' were Huck's first words when he
TOM got in. ``Please don't -- I'd be killed, sure -- but the widow's been
TOM good friends to me sometimes, and I want to tell -- I WILL tell if
TOM you'll promise you won't ever say it was me.''
TOM 
TOM ``By George, he HAS got something to tell, or he wouldn't act so!''
TOM exclaimed the old man; ``out with it and nobody here'll ever tell,
TOM lad.''
TOM 
TOM Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the
TOM hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in
TOM their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great
TOM bowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and
TOM then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.
TOM 
TOM Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as
TOM fast as his legs could carry him.
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XXX
TOM 
TOM AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came
TOM groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman's door. The
TOM inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger,
TOM on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a
TOM window:
TOM 
TOM ``Who's there!''
TOM 
TOM Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone:
TOM 
TOM ``Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!''
TOM 
TOM ``It's a name that can open this door night or day, lad! -- and
TOM welcome!''
TOM 
TOM These were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the pleasantest
TOM he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever
TOM been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he
TOM entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall
TOM sons speedily dressed themselves.
TOM 
TOM ``Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast will be
TOM ready as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot one, too --
TOM make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and
TOM stop here last night.''
TOM 
TOM ``I was awful scared,'' said Huck, ``and I run. I took out when the
TOM pistols went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now becuz
TOM I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I
TOM didn't want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it -- but
TOM there's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast. No, they
TOM ain't dead, lad -- we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right
TOM where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along
TOM on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them -- dark as a cellar
TOM that sumach path was -- and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It
TOM was the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use --
TOM 'twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol
TOM raised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get
TOM out of the path, I sung out, 'Fire boys!' and blazed away at the place
TOM where the rustling was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy,
TOM those villains, and we after them, down through the woods. I judge we
TOM never touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their
TOM bullets whizzed by and didn't do us any harm. As soon as we lost the
TOM sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the
TOM constables. They got a posse together, and went off to guard the river
TOM bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to
TOM beat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I wish we had
TOM some sort of description of those rascals -- 'twould help a good deal.
TOM But you couldn't see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh yes; I saw them down-town and follered them.''
TOM 
TOM ``Splendid! Describe them -- describe them, my boy!''
TOM 
TOM ``One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here once or
TOM twice, and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged --''
TOM 
TOM ``That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods
TOM back of the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys,
TOM and tell the sheriff -- get your breakfast to-morrow morning!''
TOM 
TOM The Welshman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck
TOM sprang up and exclaimed:
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, please don't tell ANYbody it was me that blowed on them! Oh,
TOM please!''
TOM 
TOM ``All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of
TOM what you did.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh no, no! Please don't tell!''
TOM 
TOM When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:
TOM 
TOM ``They won't tell -- and I won't. But why don't you want it known?''
TOM 
TOM Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too
TOM much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew
TOM anything against him for the whole world -- he would be killed for
TOM knowing it, sure.
TOM 
TOM The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:
TOM 
TOM ``How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking
TOM suspicious?''
TOM 
TOM Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:
TOM 
TOM ``Well, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot, -- least everybody says so,
TOM and I don't see nothing agin it -- and sometimes I can't sleep much, on
TOM account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way
TOM of doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn't sleep, and so I
TOM come along up-street 'bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I
TOM got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed
TOM up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes
TOM these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their
TOM arm, and I reckoned they'd stole it. One was a-smoking, and t'other one
TOM wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up
TOM their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,
TOM by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t'other one was a
TOM rusty, ragged-looking devil.''
TOM 
TOM ``Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?''
TOM 
TOM This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I don't know -- but somehow it seems as if I did.''
TOM 
TOM ``Then they went on, and you --''
TOM 
TOM ``Follered 'em -- yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up -- they
TOM sneaked along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and stood in the
TOM dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear
TOM he'd spile her looks just as I told you and your two --''
TOM 
TOM ``What! The DEAF AND DUMB man said all that!''
TOM 
TOM Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep
TOM the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be,
TOM and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of
TOM all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape, but
TOM the old man's eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.
TOM Presently the Welshman said:
TOM 
TOM ``My boy, don't be afraid of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head for
TOM all the world. No -- I'd protect you -- I'd protect you. This Spaniard
TOM is not deaf and dumb; you've let that slip without intending it; you
TOM can't cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you
TOM want to keep dark. Now trust me -- tell me what it is, and trust me -- I
TOM won't betray you.''
TOM 
TOM Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent over and
TOM whispered in his ear:
TOM 
TOM ``'Tain't a Spaniard -- it's Injun Joe!''
TOM 
TOM The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:
TOM 
TOM ``It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and
TOM slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because
TOM white men don't take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a
TOM different matter altogether.''
TOM 
TOM During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man
TOM said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to
TOM bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for
TOM marks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of --
TOM 
TOM ``Of WHAT?''
TOM 
TOM If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more
TOM stunning suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His eyes were staring
TOM wide, now, and his breath suspended -- waiting for the answer. The
TOM Welshman started -- stared in return -- three seconds -- five seconds --
TOM ten -- then replied:
TOM 
TOM ``Of burglar's tools. Why, what's the MATTER with you?''
TOM 
TOM Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The
TOM Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously -- and presently said:
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But
TOM what did give you that turn? What were YOU expecting we'd found?''
TOM 
TOM Huck was in a close place -- the inquiring eye was upon him -- he would
TOM have given anything for material for a plausible answer -- nothing
TOM suggested itself -- the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper -- a
TOM senseless reply offered -- there was no time to weigh it, so at a
TOM venture he uttered it -- feebly:
TOM 
TOM ``Sunday-school books, maybe.''
TOM 
TOM Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and
TOM joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and
TOM ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man's pocket, because
TOM it cut down the doctor's bill like everything. Then he added:
TOM 
TOM ``Poor old chap, you're white and jaded -- you ain't well a bit -- no
TOM wonder you're a little flighty and off your balance. But you'll come out
TOM of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.''
TOM 
TOM Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a
TOM suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel
TOM brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the
TOM talk at the widow's stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,
TOM however -- he had not known that it wasn't -- and so the suggestion of a
TOM captured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole
TOM he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all
TOM question that that bundle was not THE bundle, and so his mind was at
TOM rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be
TOM drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still in
TOM No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and Tom
TOM could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of
TOM interruption.
TOM 
TOM Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck
TOM jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even
TOM remotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and
TOM gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of
TOM citizens were climbing up the hill -- to stare at the stile. So the news
TOM had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the
TOM visitors. The widow's gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.
TOM 
TOM ``Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're more
TOM beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don't allow me
TOM to tell his name. We wouldn't have been there but for him.''
TOM 
TOM Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the
TOM main matter -- but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his
TOM visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he
TOM refused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the
TOM widow said:
TOM 
TOM ``I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that
TOM noise. Why didn't you come and wake me?''
TOM 
TOM ``We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to come
TOM again -- they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was the use
TOM of waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood
TOM guard at your house all the rest of the night. They've just come back.''
TOM 
TOM More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple
TOM of hours more.
TOM 
TOM There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody
TOM was early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came
TOM that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the
TOM sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher's wife dropped alongside of Mrs.
TOM Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired
TOM to death.''
TOM 
TOM ``Your Becky?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes,'' with a startled look -- ``didn't she stay with you last
TOM night?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, no.''
TOM 
TOM Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,
TOM talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:
TOM 
TOM ``Good-morning, Mrs. Thatcher. Good-morning, Mrs. Harper. I've got a boy
TOM that's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last
TOM night -- one of you. And now he's afraid to come to church. I've got to
TOM settle with him.''
TOM 
TOM Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.
TOM 
TOM ``He didn't stay with us,'' said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy.
TOM A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.
TOM 
TOM ``Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?''
TOM 
TOM ``No'm.''
TOM 
TOM ``When did you see him last?''
TOM 
TOM Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had
TOM stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding
TOM uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously
TOM questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed
TOM whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;
TOM it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One
TOM young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!
TOM Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her
TOM hands.
TOM 
TOM The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to
TOM street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the
TOM whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant
TOM insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs
TOM were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half
TOM an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward
TOM the cave.
TOM 
TOM All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women
TOM visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They
TOM cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the
TOM tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at
TOM last, all the word that came was, ``Send more candles -- and send
TOM food.'' Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge
TOM Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they
TOM conveyed no real cheer.
TOM 
TOM The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with
TOM candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck
TOM still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with
TOM fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came
TOM and took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,
TOM because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord's,
TOM and nothing that was the Lord's was a thing to be neglected. The
TOM Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:
TOM 
TOM ``You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it off.
TOM He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his
TOM hands.''
TOM 
TOM Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the
TOM village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the
TOM news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being
TOM ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and
TOM crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered
TOM through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither and
TOM thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their
TOM hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place,
TOM far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names ``BECKY &
TOM TOM'' had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and
TOM near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the
TOM ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever
TOM have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so
TOM precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the
TOM awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away
TOM speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst
TOM forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle -- and then
TOM a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there;
TOM it was only a searcher's light.
TOM 
TOM Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and
TOM the village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.
TOM The accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the
TOM Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the
TOM public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck
TOM feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked -- dimly
TOM dreading the worst -- if anything had been discovered at the Temperance
TOM Tavern since he had been ill.
TOM 
TOM ``Yes,'' said the widow.
TOM 
TOM Huck started up in bed, wild-eyed:
TOM 
TOM ``What? What was it?''
TOM 
TOM ``Liquor! -- and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child -- what a
TOM turn you did give me!''
TOM 
TOM ``Only tell me just one thing -- only just one -- please! Was it Tom
TOM Sawyer that found it?''
TOM 
TOM The widow burst into tears. ``Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told you
TOM before, you must NOT talk. You are very, very sick!''
TOM 
TOM Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great
TOM powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever -- gone
TOM forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should
TOM cry.
TOM 
TOM These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and under the
TOM weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:
TOM 
TOM ``There -- he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but
TOM somebody could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now, that's
TOM got hope enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.''
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XXXI
TOM 
TOM NOW to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic. They tripped along
TOM the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar
TOM wonders of the cave -- wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive
TOM names, such as ``The Drawing-Room,'' ``The Cathedral,'' ``Aladdin's
TOM Palace,'' and so on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and
TOM Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a
TOM trifle wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their
TOM candles aloft and reading the tangled web-work of names, dates,
TOM post-office addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been
TOM frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they
TOM scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls
TOM were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging
TOM shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream
TOM of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with
TOM it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara
TOM in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind
TOM it in order to illuminate it for Becky's gratification. He found that it
TOM curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between
TOM narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.
TOM Becky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future
TOM guidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,
TOM far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and
TOM branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In
TOM one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a
TOM multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a
TOM man's leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and
TOM presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it.
TOM This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was
TOM incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst
TOM of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which
TOM had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites
TOM together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the
TOM roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a
TOM bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by
TOM hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their
TOM ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky's hand and
TOM hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for
TOM a bat struck Becky's light out with its wing while she was passing out
TOM of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the
TOM fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got
TOM rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,
TOM which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the
TOM shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would
TOM be best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the
TOM deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the
TOM children. Becky said:
TOM 
TOM ``Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of
TOM the others.''
TOM 
TOM ``Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them -- and I don't know
TOM how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn't
TOM hear them here.''
TOM 
TOM Becky grew apprehensive.
TOM 
TOM ``I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start back.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better.''
TOM 
TOM ``Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me.''
TOM 
TOM ``I reckon I could find it -- but then the bats. If they put our candles
TOM out it will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so as not to go
TOM through there.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!'' and the
TOM girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.
TOM 
TOM They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long way,
TOM glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar
TOM about the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an
TOM examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he
TOM would say cheerily:
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right
TOM away!''
TOM 
TOM But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began
TOM to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of
TOM finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was ``all right,'' but
TOM there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their
TOM ring and sounded just as if he had said, ``All is lost!'' Becky clung to
TOM his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears,
TOM but they would come. At last she said:
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem to get
TOM worse and worse off all the time.''
TOM 
TOM ``Listen!'' said he.
TOM 
TOM Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were
TOM conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down the
TOM empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that
TOM resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,'' said Becky.
TOM 
TOM ``It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,'' and
TOM he shouted again.
TOM 
TOM The ``might'' was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it
TOM so confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened;
TOM but there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and
TOM hurried his steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision
TOM in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky -- he could not
TOM find his way back!
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!''
TOM 
TOM ``Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want
TOM to come back! No -- I can't find the way. It's all mixed up.''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of this awful
TOM place! Oh, why DID we ever leave the others!''
TOM 
TOM She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom
TOM was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He
TOM sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his
TOM bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing
TOM regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom
TOM begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell
TOM to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable
TOM situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope
TOM again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he
TOM would not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she,
TOM she said.
TOM 
TOM So they moved on again -- aimlessly -- simply at random -- all they
TOM could do was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show
TOM of reviving -- not with any reason to back it, but only because it is
TOM its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age
TOM and familiarity with failure.
TOM 
TOM By-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This economy meant so
TOM much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again.
TOM She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his
TOM pockets -- yet he must economize.
TOM 
TOM By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay
TOM attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was
TOM grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction,
TOM was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to
TOM invite death and shorten its pursuit.
TOM 
TOM At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.
TOM Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there, and
TOM the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom
TOM tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements
TOM were grown threadbare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore
TOM so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful.
TOM He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural
TOM under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and
TOM rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing
TOM into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and
TOM dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a
TOM breezy little laugh -- but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a
TOM groan followed it.
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, how COULD I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I
TOM don't, Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again.''
TOM 
TOM ``I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and we'll find
TOM the way out.''
TOM 
TOM ``We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I
TOM reckon we are going there.''
TOM 
TOM ``Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on trying.''
TOM 
TOM They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried
TOM to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was
TOM that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not
TOM be, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this -- they
TOM could not tell how long -- Tom said they must go softly and listen for
TOM dripping water -- they must find a spring. They found one presently, and
TOM Tom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky
TOM said she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to
TOM hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom
TOM fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought
TOM was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the
TOM silence:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, I am so hungry!''
TOM 
TOM Tom took something out of his pocket.
TOM 
TOM ``Do you remember this?'' said he.
TOM 
TOM Becky almost smiled.
TOM 
TOM ``It's our wedding-cake, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes -- I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all we've got.''
TOM 
TOM ``I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grown-up
TOM people do with wedding-cake -- but it'll be our --''
TOM 
TOM She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky
TOM ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was
TOM abundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky
TOM suggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he
TOM said:
TOM 
TOM ``Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?''
TOM 
TOM Becky's face paled, but she thought she could.
TOM 
TOM ``Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to drink.
TOM That little piece is our last candle!''
TOM 
TOM Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort
TOM her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom!''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, Becky?''
TOM 
TOM ``They'll miss us and hunt for us!''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, they will! Certainly they will!''
TOM 
TOM ``Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.''
TOM 
TOM ``When would they miss us, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM ``When they get back to the boat, I reckon.''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, it might be dark then -- would they notice we hadn't come?''
TOM 
TOM ``I don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they
TOM got home.''
TOM 
TOM A frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses and he saw
TOM that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!
TOM The children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of
TOM grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers
TOM also -- that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs.
TOM Thatcher discovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper's.
TOM 
TOM The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it
TOM melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone
TOM at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of
TOM smoke, linger at its top a moment, and then -- the horror of utter
TOM darkness reigned!
TOM 
TOM How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that
TOM she was crying in Tom's arms, neither could tell. All that they knew
TOM was, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of
TOM a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said it
TOM might be Sunday, now -- maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but
TOM her sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that
TOM they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going
TOM on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in
TOM the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no
TOM more.
TOM 
TOM The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A
TOM portion of Tom's half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But
TOM they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted
TOM desire.
TOM 
TOM By-and-by Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``SH! Did you hear that?''
TOM 
TOM Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the
TOM faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by
TOM the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently
TOM he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little
TOM nearer.
TOM 
TOM ``It's them!'' said Tom; ``they're coming! Come along, Becky -- we're
TOM all right now!''
TOM 
TOM The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,
TOM however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded
TOM against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three
TOM feet deep, it might be a hundred -- there was no passing it at any rate.
TOM Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No
TOM bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They
TOM listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant! a
TOM moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking
TOM misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He
TOM talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no
TOM sounds came again.
TOM 
TOM The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged
TOM on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed
TOM it must be Tuesday by this time.
TOM 
TOM Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It
TOM would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the
TOM heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to
TOM a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the
TOM line as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended
TOM in a ``jumping-off place.'' Tom got down on his knees and felt below,
TOM and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands
TOM conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the
TOM right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding
TOM a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,
TOM and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to -- Injun
TOM Joe's! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the
TOM next moment, to see the ``Spaniard'' take to his heels and get himself
TOM out of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and
TOM come over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must
TOM have disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom's
TOM fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he
TOM had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and
TOM nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He
TOM was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he
TOM had only shouted ``for luck.''
TOM 
TOM But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.
TOM Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought
TOM changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed
TOM that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,
TOM and that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another
TOM passage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But
TOM Becky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be
TOM roused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die -- it would
TOM not be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he
TOM chose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak to
TOM her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would
TOM stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.
TOM 
TOM Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show
TOM of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave;
TOM then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the
TOM passages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with
TOM bodings of coming doom.

TOM Chapter XXXII
TOM 
TOM TUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.
TOM Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public
TOM prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer
TOM that had the petitioner's whole heart in it; but still no good news came
TOM from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest and
TOM gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the
TOM children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great
TOM part of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her
TOM call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,
TOM then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into
TOM a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The
TOM village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.
TOM 
TOM Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village
TOM bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad
TOM people, who shouted, ``Turn out! turn out! they're found! they're
TOM found!'' Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed
TOM itself and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open
TOM carriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its
TOM homeward march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring
TOM huzzah after huzzah!
TOM 
TOM The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the
TOM greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour
TOM a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's house, seized
TOM the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher's hand, tried to
TOM speak but couldn't -- and drifted out raining tears all over the place.
TOM 
TOM Aunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so. It
TOM would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the
TOM great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon
TOM a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the
TOM wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it
TOM withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on
TOM an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his
TOM kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of
TOM the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off
TOM speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,
TOM pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad
TOM Mississippi rolling by! And if it had only happened to be night he would
TOM not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that
TOM passage any more! He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good
TOM news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was
TOM tired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted to. He described how he
TOM labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when
TOM she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how
TOM he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat
TOM there and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom
TOM hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition;
TOM how the men didn't believe the wild tale at first, ``because,'' said
TOM they, ``you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is
TOM in'' -- then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made
TOM them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.
TOM 
TOM Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him
TOM were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind
TOM them, and informed of the great news.
TOM 
TOM Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be
TOM shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were
TOM bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and
TOM more tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday,
TOM was down-town Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky
TOM did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had
TOM passed through a wasting illness.
TOM 
TOM Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could
TOM not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.
TOM He was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his
TOM adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by
TOM to see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event;
TOM also that the ``ragged man's'' body had eventually been found in the
TOM river near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to
TOM escape, perhaps.
TOM 
TOM About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started off to
TOM visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting
TOM talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge
TOM Thatcher's house was on Tom's way, and he stopped to see Becky. The
TOM Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him
TOM ironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave again. Tom said he
TOM thought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge said:
TOM 
TOM ``Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least doubt.
TOM But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any
TOM more.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why?''
TOM 
TOM ``Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago,
TOM and triple-locked -- and I've got the keys.''
TOM 
TOM Tom turned as white as a sheet.
TOM 
TOM ``What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!''
TOM 
TOM The water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.
TOM 
TOM ``Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!''
TOM 
TOM 
TOM Chapter XXXIII
TOM 
TOM WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of men
TOM were on their way to McDougal's cave, and the ferryboat, well filled
TOM with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore
TOM Judge Thatcher.
TOM 
TOM When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in
TOM the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,
TOM dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing
TOM eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer
TOM of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own
TOM experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but
TOM nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,
TOM which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated
TOM before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day
TOM he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.
TOM 
TOM Injun Joe's bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great
TOM foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with
TOM tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a
TOM sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought
TOM no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there
TOM had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless
TOM still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have
TOM squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked
TOM that place in order to be doing something -- in order to pass the weary
TOM time -- in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could
TOM find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this
TOM vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner
TOM had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a
TOM few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The
TOM poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a
TOM stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded
TOM by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off
TOM the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had
TOM scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in
TOM every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick -- a
TOM dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling
TOM when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome
TOM were laid when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the
TOM British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was
TOM ``news.'' It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these
TOM things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight
TOM of tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has
TOM everything a purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during
TOM five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect's need?
TOM and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to
TOM come? No matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed
TOM scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the
TOM tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping
TOM water when he comes to see the wonders of McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's
TOM cup stands first in the list of the cavern's marvels; even ``Aladdin's
TOM Palace'' cannot rival it.
TOM 
TOM Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked
TOM there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and
TOM hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and all
TOM sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as
TOM satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the
TOM hanging.
TOM 
TOM This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing -- the petition to
TOM the governor for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had been largely
TOM signed; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a
TOM committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail
TOM around the governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample
TOM his duty under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens
TOM of the village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there
TOM would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a
TOM pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired
TOM and leaky water-works.
TOM 
TOM The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have
TOM an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom's adventure from the
TOM Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned
TOM there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted
TOM to talk about now. Huck's face saddened. He said:
TOM 
TOM ``I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but
TOM whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben
TOM you, soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you
TOM hadn't got the money becuz you'd 'a' got at me some way or other and
TOM told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something's always
TOM told me we'd never get holt of that swag.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. YOU know his tavern was
TOM all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you remember you was
TOM to watch there that night?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very night that I
TOM follered Injun Joe to the widder's.''
TOM 
TOM ``YOU followed him?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes -- but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him,
TOM and I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it
TOM hadn't ben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all right.''
TOM 
TOM Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only
TOM heard of the Welshman's part of it before.
TOM 
TOM ``Well,'' said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question,
TOM ``whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon
TOM -- anyways it's a goner for us, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!''
TOM 
TOM ``What!'' Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. ``Tom, have you got
TOM on the track of that money again?''
TOM 
TOM ``Huck, it's in the cave!''
TOM 
TOM Huck's eyes blazed.
TOM 
TOM ``Say it again, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``The money's in the cave!''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom -- honest injun, now -- is it fun, or earnest?''
TOM 
TOM ``Earnest, Huck -- just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go
TOM in there with me and help get it out?''
TOM 
TOM ``I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not
TOM get lost.''
TOM 
TOM ``Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the
TOM world.''
TOM 
TOM ``Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's --''
TOM 
TOM ``Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll
TOM agree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the world. I will,
TOM by jings.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right -- it's a whiz. When do you say?''
TOM 
TOM ``Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?''
TOM 
TOM ``Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,
TOM now, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom -- least I don't think I
TOM could.''
TOM 
TOM ``It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,
TOM but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me know
TOM about. Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff. I'll float the skiff
TOM down there, and I'll pull it back again all by myself. You needn't ever
TOM turn your hand over.''
TOM 
TOM ``Less start right off, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little
TOM bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled
TOM things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's the time I wished I
TOM had some when I was in there before.''
TOM 
TOM A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who
TOM was absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles
TOM below ``Cave Hollow,'' Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the
TOM cave hollow -- no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you
TOM see that white place up yonder where there's been a landslide? Well,
TOM that's one of my marks. We'll get ashore, now.''
TOM 
TOM They landed.
TOM 
TOM ``Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out
TOM of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.''
TOM 
TOM Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly
TOM marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this
TOM country. You just keep mum about it. All along I've been wanting to be a
TOM robber, but I knew I'd got to have a thing like this, and where to run
TOM across it was the bother. We've got it now, and we'll keep it quiet,
TOM only we'll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in -- because of course there's
TOM got to be a Gang, or else there wouldn't be any style about it. Tom
TOM Sawyer's Gang -- it sounds splendid, don't it, Huck?''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, most anybody. Waylay people -- that's mostly the way.''
TOM 
TOM ``And kill them?''
TOM 
TOM ``No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.''
TOM 
TOM ``What's a ransom?''
TOM 
TOM ``Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and
TOM after you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them.
TOM That's the general way. Only you don't kill the women. You shut up the
TOM women, but you don't kill them. They're always beautiful and rich, and
TOM awfully scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take
TOM your hat off and talk polite. They ain't anybody as polite as robbers --
TOM you'll see that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and
TOM after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and
TOM after that you couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd
TOM turn right around and come back. It's so in all the books.''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a pirate.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses
TOM and all that.''
TOM 
TOM By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in
TOM the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then
TOM made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought
TOM them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him. He
TOM showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay
TOM against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame
TOM struggle and expire.
TOM 
TOM The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and
TOM gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently
TOM entered and followed Tom's other corridor until they reached the
TOM ``jumping-off place.'' The candles revealed the fact that it was not
TOM really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet
TOM high. Tom whispered:
TOM 
TOM ``Now I'll show you something, Huck.''
TOM 
TOM He held his candle aloft and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There -- on
TOM the big rock over yonder -- done with candle-smoke.''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, it's a CROSS!''
TOM 
TOM ``NOW where's your Number Two? 'UNDER THE CROSS,' hey? Right yonder's
TOM where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!''
TOM 
TOM Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, less git out of here!''
TOM 
TOM ``What! and leave the treasure?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes -- leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there, certain.''
TOM 
TOM ``No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where he died
TOM -- away out at the mouth of the cave -- five mile from here.''
TOM 
TOM ``No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the ways
TOM of ghosts, and so do you.''
TOM 
TOM Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his mind.
TOM But presently an idea occurred to him --
TOM 
TOM ``Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun Joe's
TOM ghost ain't a going to come around where there's a cross!''
TOM 
TOM The point was well taken. It had its effect.
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that
TOM cross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that
TOM box.''
TOM 
TOM Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.
TOM Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the
TOM great rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.
TOM They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with
TOM a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some
TOM bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there
TOM was no money-box. The lads searched and researched this place, but in
TOM vain. Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``He said UNDER the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the
TOM cross. It can't be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the
TOM ground.''
TOM 
TOM They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck
TOM could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:
TOM 
TOM ``Lookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle-grease on the clay
TOM about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what's
TOM that for? I bet you the money IS under the rock. I'm going to dig in the
TOM clay.''
TOM 
TOM ``That ain't no bad notion, Tom!'' said Huck with animation.
TOM 
TOM Tom's ``real Barlow'' was out at once, and he had not dug four inches
TOM before he struck wood.
TOM 
TOM ``Hey, Huck! -- you hear that?''
TOM 
TOM Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and
TOM removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.
TOM Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could,
TOM but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed to
TOM explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended
TOM gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to
TOM the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and
TOM exclaimed:
TOM 
TOM ``My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!''
TOM 
TOM It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,
TOM along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two
TOM or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish
TOM well soaked with the water-drip.
TOM 
TOM ``Got it at last!'' said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with
TOM his hand. ``My, but we're rich, Tom!''
TOM 
TOM ``Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe,
TOM but we HAVE got it, sure! Say -- let's not fool around here. Let's snake
TOM it out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.''
TOM 
TOM It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward
TOM fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.
TOM 
TOM ``I thought so,'' he said; ``THEY carried it like it was heavy, that day
TOM at the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of
TOM fetching the little bags along.''
TOM 
TOM The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross
TOM rock.
TOM 
TOM ``Now less fetch the guns and things,'' said Huck.
TOM 
TOM ``No, Huck -- leave them there. They're just the tricks to have when we
TOM go to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and we'll hold our
TOM orgies there, too. It's an awful snug place for orgies.''
TOM 
TOM ``What orgies?''
TOM 
TOM ``I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got to
TOM have them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's
TOM getting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and smoke when we get
TOM to the skiff.''
TOM 
TOM They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily
TOM out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the
TOM skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got
TOM under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting
TOM cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.
TOM 
TOM ``Now, Huck,'' said Tom, ``we'll hide the money in the loft of the
TOM widow's woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count it and
TOM divide, and then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it
TOM will be safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and
TOM hook Benny Taylor's little wagon; I won't be gone a minute.''
TOM 
TOM He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small
TOM sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off,
TOM dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman's
TOM house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the
TOM Welshman stepped out and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Hallo, who's that?''
TOM 
TOM ``Huck and Tom Sawyer.''
TOM 
TOM ``Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.
TOM Here -- hurry up, trot ahead -- I'll haul the wagon for you. Why, it's
TOM not as light as it might be. Got bricks in it? -- or old metal?''
TOM 
TOM ``Old metal,'' said Tom.
TOM 
TOM ``I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool
TOM away more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell to the
TOM foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But
TOM that's human nature -- hurry along, hurry along!''
TOM 
TOM The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.
TOM 
TOM ``Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'.''
TOM 
TOM Huck said with some apprehension -- for he was long used to being
TOM falsely accused:
TOM 
TOM ``Mr. Jones, we haven't been doing nothing.''
TOM 
TOM The Welshman laughed.
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that. Ain't you
TOM and the widow good friends?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, anyway.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?''
TOM 
TOM This question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind before he
TOM found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas' drawing-room.
TOM Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.
TOM 
TOM The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence
TOM in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the
TOM Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great
TOM many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys as
TOM heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They
TOM were covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson
TOM with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered
TOM half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:
TOM 
TOM ``Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and
TOM Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.''
TOM 
TOM ``And you did just right,'' said the widow. ``Come with me, boys.''
TOM 
TOM She took them to a bedchamber and said:
TOM 
TOM ``Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes --
TOM shirts, socks, everything complete. They're Huck's -- no, no thanks,
TOM Huck -- Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they'll fit both of
TOM you. Get into them. We'll wait -- come down when you are slicked up
TOM enough.''
TOM 
TOM Then she left.

TOM Chapter XXXIV
TOM 
TOM HUCK said: ``Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain't
TOM high from the ground.''
TOM 
TOM ``Shucks! what do you want to slope for?''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I ain't used to that kind of a crowd. I can't stand it. I ain't
TOM going down there, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, bother! It ain't anything. I don't mind it a bit. I'll take care
TOM of you.''
TOM 
TOM Sid appeared.
TOM 
TOM ``Tom,'' said he, ``auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon.
TOM Mary got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody's been fretting about
TOM you. Say -- ain't this grease and clay, on your clothes?''
TOM 
TOM ``Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist 'tend to your own business. What's all this
TOM blow-out about, anyway?''
TOM 
TOM ``It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having. This time
TOM it's for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they
TOM helped her out of the other night. And say -- I can tell you something,
TOM if you want to know.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, what?''
TOM 
TOM ``Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people
TOM here to-night, but I overheard him tell auntie to-day about it, as a
TOM secret, but I reckon it's not much of a secret now. Everybody knows --
TOM the widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don't. Mr. Jones was
TOM bound Huck should be here -- couldn't get along with his grand secret
TOM without Huck, you know!''
TOM 
TOM ``Secret about what, Sid?''
TOM 
TOM ``About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr. Jones was
TOM going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop
TOM pretty flat.''
TOM 
TOM Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.
TOM 
TOM ``Sid, was it you that told?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, never mind who it was. SOMEBODY told -- that's enough.''
TOM 
TOM ``Sid, there's only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and
TOM that's you. If you had been in Huck's place you'd 'a' sneaked down the
TOM hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can't do any but mean
TOM things, and you can't bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.
TOM There -- no thanks, as the widow says'' -- and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and
TOM helped him to the door with several kicks. ``Now go and tell auntie if
TOM you dare -- and to-morrow you'll catch it!''
TOM 
TOM Some minutes later the widow's guests were at the supper-table, and a
TOM dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,
TOM after the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.
TOM Jones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the
TOM honor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was
TOM another person whose modesty --
TOM 
TOM And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck's share in the
TOM adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the
TOM surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and
TOM effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However, the
TOM widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many
TOM compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the
TOM nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely
TOM intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody's gaze
TOM and everybody's laudations.
TOM 
TOM The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him
TOM educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in
TOM business in a modest way. Tom's chance was come. He said:
TOM 
TOM ``Huck don't need it. Huck's rich.''
TOM 
TOM Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept
TOM back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But
TOM the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:
TOM 
TOM ``Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots of it.
TOM Oh, you needn't smile -- I reckon I can show you. You just wait a
TOM minute.''
TOM 
TOM Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed
TOM interest -- and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.
TOM 
TOM ``Sid, what ails Tom?'' said Aunt Polly. ``He -- well, there ain't ever
TOM any making of that boy out. I never --''
TOM 
TOM Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly did
TOM not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the
TOM table and said:
TOM 
TOM ``There -- what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half of it's
TOM mine!''
TOM 
TOM The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for
TOM a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said
TOM he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of
TOM interest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the
TOM charm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:
TOM 
TOM ``I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it
TOM don't amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I'm
TOM willing to allow.''
TOM 
TOM The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand
TOM dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time
TOM before, though several persons were there who were worth considerably
TOM more than that in property.

TOM 
TOM Chapter XXXV
TOM 
TOM THE reader may rest satisfied that Tom's and Huck's windfall made a
TOM mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a sum,
TOM all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked about,
TOM gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens
TOM tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every ``haunted''
TOM house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected,
TOM plank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden
TOM treasure -- and not by boys, but men -- pretty grave, unromantic men,
TOM too, some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted,
TOM admired, stared at. The boys were not able to remember that their
TOM remarks had possessed weight before; but now their sayings were
TOM treasured and repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be
TOM regarded as remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and
TOM saying commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and
TOM discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper
TOM published biographical sketches of the boys.
TOM 
TOM The Widow Douglas put Huck's money out at six per cent., and Judge
TOM Thatcher did the same with Tom's at Aunt Polly's request. Each lad had
TOM an income, now, that was simply prodigious -- a dollar for every
TOM week-day in the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the
TOM minister got -- no, it was what he was promised -- he generally couldn't
TOM collect it. A dollar and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school
TOM a boy in those old simple days -- and clothe him and wash him, too, for
TOM that matter.
TOM 
TOM Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no
TOM commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When
TOM Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her
TOM whipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded
TOM grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that
TOM whipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine
TOM outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie -- a lie
TOM that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history
TOM breast to breast with George Washington's lauded Truth about the
TOM hatchet! Becky thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb
TOM as when he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went
TOM straight off and told Tom about it.
TOM 
TOM Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some
TOM day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the
TOM National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school
TOM in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or
TOM both.
TOM 
TOM Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas'
TOM protection introduced him into society -- no, dragged him into it,
TOM hurled him into it -- and his sufferings were almost more than he could
TOM bear. The widow's servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed,
TOM and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one
TOM little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a
TOM friend. He had to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup,
TOM and plate; he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to
TOM talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth;
TOM whithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him
TOM in and bound him hand and foot.
TOM 
TOM He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up
TOM missing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in
TOM great distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high
TOM and low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning
TOM Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind
TOM the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee.
TOM Huck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and
TOM ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was
TOM unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made
TOM him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him
TOM out, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home.
TOM Huck's face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He
TOM said:
TOM 
TOM ``Don't talk about it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work; it don't
TOM work, Tom. It ain't for me; I ain't used to it. The widder's good to me,
TOM and friendly; but I can't stand them ways. She makes me get up just at
TOM the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all to
TOM thunder; she won't let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them
TOM blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don't seem to any air
TOM git through 'em, somehow; and they're so rotten nice that I can't set
TOM down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher's; I hain't slid on a
TOM cellar-door for -- well, it 'pears to be years; I got to go to church
TOM and sweat and sweat -- I hate them ornery sermons! I can't ketch a fly
TOM in there, I can't chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats
TOM by a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell --
TOM everything's so awful reg'lar a body can't stand it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, everybody does that way, Huck.''
TOM 
TOM ``Tom, it don't make no difference. I ain't everybody, and I can't STAND
TOM it. It's awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy -- I don't take
TOM no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing; I got to
TOM ask to go in a-swimming -- dern'd if I hain't got to ask to do
TOM everything. Well, I'd got to talk so nice it wasn't no comfort -- I'd
TOM got to go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste
TOM in my mouth, or I'd a died, Tom. The widder wouldn't let me smoke; she
TOM wouldn't let me yell, she wouldn't let me gape, nor stretch, nor
TOM scratch, before folks --'' [Then with a spasm of special irritation and
TOM injury] -- ``And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such
TOM a woman! I HAD to shove, Tom -- I just had to. And besides, that
TOM school's going to open, and I'd a had to go to it -- well, I wouldn't
TOM stand THAT, Tom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain't what it's cracked up
TOM to be. It's just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you
TOM was dead all the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar'l suits
TOM me, and I ain't ever going to shake 'em any more. Tom, I wouldn't ever
TOM got into all this trouble if it hadn't 'a' ben for that money; now you
TOM just take my sheer of it along with your'n, and gimme a ten-center
TOM sometimes -- not many times, becuz I don't give a dern for a thing
TOM 'thout it's tollable hard to git -- and you go and beg off for me with
TOM the widder.''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, Huck, you know I can't do that. 'Tain't fair; and besides if
TOM you'll try this thing just a while longer you'll come to like it.''
TOM 
TOM ``Like it! Yes -- the way I'd like a hot stove if I was to set on it
TOM long enough. No, Tom, I won't be rich, and I won't live in them cussed
TOM smothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and
TOM I'll stick to 'em, too. Blame it all! just as we'd got guns, and a cave,
TOM and all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up
TOM and spile it all!''
TOM 
TOM Tom saw his opportunity --
TOM 
TOM ``Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from turning
TOM robber.''
TOM 
TOM ``No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM ``Just as dead earnest as I'm sitting here. But Huck, we can't let you
TOM into the gang if you ain't respectable, you know.''
TOM 
TOM Huck's joy was quenched.
TOM 
TOM ``Can't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, but that's different. A robber is more high-toned than what a
TOM pirate is -- as a general thing. In most countries they're awful high up
TOM in the nobility -- dukes and such.''
TOM 
TOM ``Now, Tom, hain't you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn't shet me
TOM out, would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, WOULD you, Tom?''
TOM 
TOM ``Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I DON'T want to -- but what would people
TOM say? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty low characters in
TOM it!' They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like that, and I wouldn't.''
TOM 
TOM Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he
TOM said:
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if
TOM I can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll ask the
TOM widow to let up on you a little, Huck.''
TOM 
TOM ``Will you, Tom -- now will you? That's good. If she'll let up on some
TOM of the roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd
TOM through or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?''
TOM 
TOM ``Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the initiation
TOM to-night, maybe.''
TOM 
TOM ``Have the which?''
TOM 
TOM ``Have the initiation.''
TOM 
TOM ``What's that?''
TOM 
TOM ``It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang's
TOM secrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and
TOM all his family that hurts one of the gang.''
TOM 
TOM ``That's gay -- that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at midnight,
TOM in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find -- a ha'nted house is the
TOM best, but they're all ripped up now.''
TOM 
TOM ``Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom.''
TOM 
TOM ``Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with
TOM blood.''
TOM 
TOM ``Now, that's something LIKE! Why, it's a million times bullier than
TOM pirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be a
TOM reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout it, I reckon
TOM she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.''
TOM 
TOM 
TOM CONCLUSION
TOM 
TOM SO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a BOY, it must
TOM stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the
TOM history of a MAN. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows
TOM exactly where to stop -- that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of
TOM juveniles, he must stop where he best can.
TOM 
TOM Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are
TOM prosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the
TOM story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they
TOM turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that
TOM part of their lives at present.
